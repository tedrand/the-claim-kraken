Palo Alto Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., No.\n IPR2016-00151, Paper 68 (P.T.A.B. May 15, 2019), J.A. 1\u2013\n 7 (\u201cRemand FWD\u201d). 1 In the Remand FWD, the Board held\n that claims 1\u201312 of U.S. Patent No. 8,141,154 (\u201cthe \u2019154\n patent\u201d), owned by Finjan, Inc. (\u201cFinjan\u201d), had not been\n shown to be unpatentable in the inter partes review\n proceeding brought by Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (\u201cPalo\n Alto\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. 2\n\n\n\n     1    IPR2016-01071, filed by Symantec Corp. (\u201cSyman-\n tec\u201d), sought review of the same claims as, and was ulti-\n mately joined with, IPR2016-00151. Due to a previous\n settlement, Symantec is not a party to this appeal, and no\n argument is raised by the parties with respect to IPR2016-\n 01071. See Remand FWD at 1 n.1.\n     2    Initially, Palo Alto argued that we should vacate\n and remand the Remand FWD because it was rendered by\n an unconstitutionally appointed panel of Administrative\n Patent Judges, citing our court\u2019s decision in Arthrex, Inc. v.\n Smith & Nephew, Inc., 941 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Br. 49. The U.S. Patent & Trademark Office\n\fCase: 19-2151     Document: 61      Page: 3   Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v. FINJAN, INC.                  3\n\n\n\n                        BACKGROUND\n                               I\n     The \u2019154 patent relates to anti-virus protection for com-\n puters, and specifically, to protection against dynamically\n generated malicious code or viruses, which are viruses gen-\n erated at run-time. \u2019154 patent col. 3 ll. 33\u201338 & col. 8 ll.\n 38\u201340. The \u2019154 patent describes using a separate, re-\n motely-located security computer to inspect incoming con-\n tent to determine if it is safe to run the content on a client\n computer. Id. col. 4 ll. 35\u201354. More specifically, the \u2019154\n patent explains that when content is received at the client\n computer that includes \u201ca call to an original function\u201d and\n the call includes \u201can input to the function,\u201d the call to the\n original function is replaced with a \u201ccall to a substitute\n function.\u201d Id. col. 5 ll. 4\u201312. The substitute function causes\n the input to be sent to the security computer, which then\n determines whether it is safe for the client computer to in-\n voke the original function with the input. Id. col. 5 ll. 12\u2013\n 20. If the security computer determines it is safe, the orig-\n inal function can be invoked at the client computer with\n the input. Id. col. 5 ll. 22\u201325.\n     Independent claim 1 of the \u2019154 patent is representa-\n tive. It provides as follows:\n\n\n\n\n intervened with respect to this issue. The Supreme Court\n subsequently granted certiorari in Arthrex, 2020 WL\n 6037208 (Oct. 13, 2020), and Palo Alto then filed a motion\n to stay this appeal, which our court denied. As the peti-\n tioner before the Board in IPR2016-00151, Palo Alto has\n forfeited its right to an Arthrex challenge. See generally\n Ciena Corp. v. Oyster Optics, LLC, 958 F.3d 1157 (Fed. Cir.\n 2020).\n\fCase: 19-2151      Document: 61      Page: 4     Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                      PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.    v. FINJAN, INC.\n\n\n\n     1. A system for protecting a computer from dy-\n     namically generated malicious content, compris-\n     ing:\n     a content processor (i) for processing content re-\n     ceived over a network, the content including a call\n     to a first function, and the call including an input,\n     and (ii) for invoking a second function with the in-\n     put, only if a security computer indicates that such\n     invocation is safe;\n     a transmitter for transmitting the input to the se-\n     curity computer for inspection, when the first func-\n     tion is invoked; and\n     a receiver for receiving an indicator from the secu-\n     rity computer whether it is safe to invoke the sec-\n     ond function with the input.\n Id. col. 17 ll. 32\u201344 (emphasis added). The claimed \u201cfirst\n function\u201d refers to the substitute function, whereas the\n claimed \u201csecond function\u201d refers to the original function\n that the client computer has been asked to perform. Thus,\n the term at issue, \u201ca call to a first function,\u201d refers to a call\n to the substitute function that causes the input to be sent\n to a security computer for inspection.\n     The only prior art at issue is U.S. Patent Application\n Publication No. 2007/0113282 to Ross (\u201cRoss\u201d). Ross de-\n scribes systems and methods for detecting and disabling\n malicious script code. Specifically, Ross teaches a \u201chook\u201d-\n based detection engine that is configured to review script\n code associated with incoming data content and detect\n function calls in the script code. Ross \u00b6\u00b6 10, 25. The hook-\n base detection engine includes a hook script generator that\n creates new \u201chooked\u201d or \u201chook\u201d functions that replace the\n standard functions originally set forth in the script code,\n thereby replacing potentially malicious functions con-\n tained in the script code. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 26, 35. As discussed\n below, the issue on appeal is whether Ross discloses \u201ca call\n\fCase: 19-2151     Document: 61       Page: 5    Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v. FINJAN, INC.                    5\n\n\n\n to a first function,\u201d as recited in the \u2019154 patent and as con-\n strued by the Board.\n                                II\n     On March 15, 2017, the Board issued a Final Written\n decision in IPR2016-00151. Final Written Decision, Palo\n Alto Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., No. IPR2016-00151,\n 2017 WL 1040254 (P.T.A.B. Mar. 15, 2017) (\u201cOriginal\n FWD\u201d). In it, the Board construed \u201ca call to a first function\u201d\n to mean \u201ca statement or instruction in a program request-\n ing the services of a particular (i.e., first) function.\u201d Id. at\n *3\u20134. In the Original FWD, the Board determined that\n claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11 were patentable over Ross because\n Ross did not disclose the claimed \u201ccontent including a call\n to a first function.\u201d Id. at *5\u20138. 3 The Board rejected Palo\n Alto\u2019s argument that Ross\u2019s hook function teaches or sug-\n gests the \u201ccall to a first function.\u201d The Board concluded:\n \u201cRoss teaches assigning the original function to the hooked\n function. In that manner, Ross invokes indirectly the hook\n function without any need to include a call to that hook\n function.\u201d Id. at *7.\n      Palo Alto sought rehearing of the Original FWD be-\n cause the Board used different language in its construction\n of the term \u201ccall to a first function\u201d in a Final Written De-\n cision in IPR2015-01979, which issued the same day as the\n Original FWD and which also involved the \u2019154 patent. In\n the Final Written Decision in IPR2015-01979, the Board\n construed \u201ca call to a first function\u201d to mean \u201ca statement\n\n\n\n     3   Palo Alto\u2019s petition in IPR2016-00151 challenged\n claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11 of the \u2019154 patent as obvious under\n 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 over Ross and claims 9 and 12 as obvious\n over Ross and U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2002/0066022 to\n Calder (\u201cCalder\u201d). The Board instituted review of Palo\n Alto\u2019s challenge to claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11, but declined to\n institute its challenge to claims 9 and 12.\n\fCase: 19-2151     Document: 61     Page: 6    Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                     PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v.

Finjan, Inc., No. IPR2015-\n 01979, 2017 WL 1040259, at *7 (P.T.A.B. Mar. 15, 2017).\n The Board granted Palo Alto\u2019s Request for Rehearing, and\n agreed with Palo Alto \u201cthat the construction of \u2018a call to a\n first function\u2019 must be consistent with [its] determination\n in IPR2015-01979,\u201d specifically, that \u201ca call to a first func-\n tion\u201d means \u201ca statement or instruction in the content, the\n execution of which causes the function to provide a service.\u201d\n Decision on Petitioner\u2019s Request for Rehearing, Palo Alto\n Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., No. IPR2016-00151, 2017\n WL 2211715, at *1 (P.T.A.B. May 19, 2017) (\u201cRehearing\n Decision\u201d). The Board concluded, however, that the modi-\n fied construction was consistent with its prior analysis and\n did not require modification of its patentability determina-\n tions. Id. at *1\u20132. The Board stated: \u201c[W]e do not agree\n with [Palo Alto]\u2019s argument that this construction expands\n the scope of the term to include \u2018invocations\u2019 of a function\n when the \u2018call\u2019 is to another function.\u201d Id. at *1.\n      Palo Alto appealed the Original FWD and the Final\n Written Decision in IPR2015-01979. In a November 19,\n 2018 decision, our court issued an opinion in which we\n (1) affirmed the Board\u2019s construction of a disputed claim\n term in IPR2015-01979; and (2) vacated and remanded the\n Board\u2019s decision in IPR2016-00151 under SAS Institute\n Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348 (2018), because the Board had\n instituted IPR2016-00151 on less than all of the challenged\n claims. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., 752 F.\n App\u2019x 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\n     On remand, the Board modified its institution decision\n to institute inter partes review of dependent claims 9 and\n 12. Remand FWD at 3, J.A. 3. The Board also \u201cadopt[ed]\n and incorporate[d] by reference, in its entirety, [its] previ-\n ous [Original FWD] that [Palo Alto] ha[d] not shown by a\n preponderance of the evidence that claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11\n of the \u2019154 patent are unpatentable\u201d and \u201creinstate[d],\n\fCase: 19-2151    Document: 61       Page: 7   Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v.

Remand FWD at 4, J.A. 4.\n The Board found that newly challenged claims 9 and 12\n had not been shown to be unpatentable because Palo Alto\n did not \u201cpoint to any teachings in Calder that teach the el-\n ements [the Board] found missing in Ross in reaching [its]\n decision that Ross did not render claims 1 and 10,\u201d from\n which claims 9 and 12 depend, \u201cobvious.\u201d Id. at 4\u20136.\n     Palo Alto now appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant\n to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A).\n                        DISCUSSION\n                               I\n     For petitions for inter partes review filed on or after\n November 13, 2018, the Board applies the Phillips district-\n court claim construction standard. 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.100(b)\n (2018); Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir.\n 2005) (en banc); Immunex Corp. v. Sanofi-Aventis U.S.\n LLC, 977 F.3d 1212, 1216 & n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2020). For peti-\n tions for inter partes review filed before November 13,\n 2018, like Palo Alto\u2019s, we apply the broadest reasonable in-\n terpretation claim construction standard.        37 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 42.100(b) (2012); AC Tech. S.A. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 912\n F.3d 1358, 1365 n.1 (Fed.

FINJAN, INC.\n\n\n\n                               II\n      As noted, the Board ultimately construed \u201ca call to a\n first function\u201d to mean \u201ca statement or instruction in the\n content, the execution of which causes the function to pro-\n vide a service.\u201d Rehearing Decision, 2017 WL2211715 at\n *1. This was the construction first stated in IPR2015-\n 01979.\n     In Palo Alto\u2019s view, the Board improperly added a lim-\n itation to the claims\u2014that the \u201ccall\u201d must directly name\n the first function\u2014when it construed the term as just\n stated and applied the construction to Ross. Palo Alto con-\n tends that the Board\u2019s original construction in IPR2016-\n 00151 (\u201ca statement or instruction in a program requesting\n the services of a particular (i.e., first) function\u201d) required\n that the first function be explicitly called, and when the\n Board modified the Original FWD in IPR2016-00151 to\n make the construction there consistent with the construc-\n tion in IPR2015-01979, the Board should have revisited its\n invalidity analysis under the new construction, which was\n not so limited. Appellant Br. 36\u201341.\n     According to Palo Alto, Ross teaches a \u201ccall to a first\n function\u201d through its description of the hook functions and\n their associated inputs. Id. at 43\u201348. For example, Palo\n Alto points out that Ross teaches \u201c[e]ach hook function is\n configured to supersede a corresponding original function\u201d\n and that \u201c[t]he hook function corresponding to the data\n content original function is executed when the original\n function is called.\u201d Id. at 44, 46 (quoting Ross \u00b6 10).\n      Finjan responds that Palo Alto\u2019s argument that the\n claim construction was not correctly applied is meritless\n because it \u201cignores the fundamental difference between a\n function call and the invocation of a function.\u201d Appellee\u2019s\n Br. 15. Finjan notes that Palo Alto does not challenge the\n Board\u2019s claim construction itself and indeed Palo Alto spe-\n cifically requested that the construction in IPR2015-01979\n be applied in IPR2016-00151.

Id. at\n 17\u201318, 20, 24.\n                               III\n     We have recognized a party\u2019s ability to challenge the\n Board\u2019s application of a claim construction. Respironics,\n Inc. v. Zoll Med. Corp., 656 F. App\u2019x 531, 535 (Fed. Cir.\n 2016) (first citing In re Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., 696 F.3d\n 1142, 1150-51 (Fed. Cir. 2012), then citing Intervet Inc. v.\n Merial Ltd., 617 F.3d 1282, 1289-90 (Fed. Cir. 2010)). \u201cOur\n analysis of this issue includes two components: first, we de-\n termine whether the Board added a limitation when it ap-\n plied the construction; second, we determine whether that\n limitation is appropriate under claim-construction law.\u201d\n Id.\n      Applying this test, we do not believe the Board added a\n direct-naming limitation when it applied its construction.\n Rather, the Board consistently explained that the term \u201ca\n call to a function\u201d is simply not equal to \u201cinvoking a func-\n tion.\u201d Original FWD, 2017 WL 1040254, at *4; Rehearing\n Decision, 2017 WL2211715 at *2. The Board explained\n that the term \u201ccall\u201d was used in the claims as a noun to\n mean a \u201cprogrammatic statement included in the content.\u201d\n Original FWD, 2017 WL 1040254 at *4; Rehearing Deci-\n sion, 2017 WL2211715 at *2 (\u201cThe word \u2018call\u2019 is recited in\n claim 1 as a noun, and is the statement or instruction in-\n cluded in the content . . . .\u201d). According to the Board, such\n a programmatic statement to a function must \u201ccause[ ]\n the . . . function to provide a service.\u201d Rehearing Decision,\n 2017 WL2211715 at *2 (\u201cThe word \u201ccall\u201d . . . is the state-\n ment or instruction included in the content that causes the\n first function to provide a service.\u201d). The Board also con-\n sistently explained that such a \u201ccall\u201d to a function does not\n encompass the invocation of a different function. Id. at *1\u2013\n\fCase: 19-2151    Document: 61      Page: 10    Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                   PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v. FINJAN, INC.\n\n\n\n 2; see Original FWD, 2017 WL 1040254 at *4. The Board\u2019s\n construction, and its application thereof, thus requires no\n more than what is recited in the claims: \u201c[t]he call to the\n first function must be included in the content, and it is the\n same first function that is invoked later in the claim.\u201d Id.\n at *4.\n     The Board found that Ross teaches a call to the original\n (second) function, in order to invoke the hook (first) func-\n tion, but does not teach a \u201ccall\u201d to the hook function. Id. at\n *6. This finding is supported by substantial evidence, in-\n cluding the testimony of Finjan\u2019s expert, see, e.g., Original\n FWD, 2017 WL 1040254, at *6, and the testimony of Palo\n Alto\u2019s expert that \u201cin the pseudocode in figure 4 [of Ross]\n there\u2019s no explicit call to a hooked function.\u201d Id. at *7.\n\n\n                         CONCLUSION\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Remand\n FWD. 4\n                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n      4 We have considered the other arguments raised by\n Palo Alto on appeal and have found them to be without\n merit.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4269448/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107160/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/152228/"], "case_name": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. v.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n\n    Before LOURIE, O\u2019MALLEY, and REYNA, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n     Cornell Howard appeals from the decision of the Court\n of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cthe Veterans Court\u201d) af-\n firming a decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cthe\n Board\u201d) denying service connection. See Howard v. Wilkie,\n No. 18-1487, 2019 WL 5598324 (Vet. App. Oct. 31, 2019)\n (\u201cDecision\u201d). Because Howard raises only factual issues\n over which we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\n                       BACKGROUND\n      Howard served on active duty in the Marine Corps\n from November 1975 to October 1976. Howard\u2019s entrance\n medical examination reported no abnormalities. Service\n Treatment Records (\u201cSTRs\u201d) reveal that Howard was\n treated for multiple abdominal issues during his service.\n In January 1976, Howard received treatment for an inter-\n mittent mid-epigastric dull ache. In May 1976, Howard re-\n ported to the emergency room complaining of severe\n abdominal pain. At the time of discharge a physician noted\n that the cause of the pain was of \u201cunknown etiology,\u201d and\n follow-up examination showed no abnormality. In Septem-\n ber 1976, Howard received treatment for a rash and nodule\n lump in his groin area. Howard was discharged in October\n 1976, and his separation examination was normal with no\n noted abnormalities relating to his abdomen or groin.\n     In November 1980, Howard sought disability compen-\n sation for a lower abdominal problem, claiming that he had\n undergone a hernia repair procedure after service in 1977\n at a Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) medical facility\n in St. Louis. Howard alleged that he was injured during a\n training exercise while carrying a military cannon which\n was abruptly dropped by other service members carrying\n the cannon, leaving Howard to hold onto the weapon that\n weighed several hundred pounds and causing his hernia\n\fCase: 20-1880     Document: 29    Page: 3    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n HOWARD   v. WILKIE                                        3\n\n\n\n injury. VA denied Howard\u2019s claim in 1984, finding that\n service records did not confirm the existence of any chronic\n disability, and Howard did not appeal.\n     In 2011, Howard filed another disability compensation\n claim for hernia residuals. Howard restated his claim that\n he had undergone a hernia operation in St. Louis and\n added allegations that the military physician who per-\n formed his separation exam told him he had a right ingui-\n nal hernia and that he had undergone a second hernia\n operation in Denver. VA unsuccessfully sought records of\n both procedures and issued a formal finding of unavailabil-\n ity of records. VA obtained a medical examination to de-\n termine whether Howard had a hernia disorder connected\n to his service. The examiner noted that Howard had a her-\n nia in the past and opined that the hernia was less likely\n than not incurred in or caused by Howard\u2019s claimed in-ser-\n vice injury, and VA denied service connection.\n      Howard appealed to the Board. The Board held a hear-\n ing during which he again reported that he injured himself\n lifting a cannon but also mentioned for the first time an\n injury while lifting a tree during basic training. The Board\n discounted the credibility of Howard\u2019s statements for lack\n of consistency and, relying on Howard\u2019s STRs and the 2012\n examination, denied service connection.\n      Howard appealed to the Veterans Court, which af-\n firmed the Board\u2019s decision. Specifically, the court found\n that VA satisfied its duty to assist Howard under 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 5103A because it sought records of his two alleged hernia\n operations even though the records ultimately proved una-\n vailable. Decision, 2019 WL 5598324, at *3. With respect\n to the cannon incident, the court concluded that the duty\n to assist did not extend to obtaining STRs of fellow Marines\n who were present at the time because \u201cthere is no apparent\n reason why the marines who served with Mr. Howard\n would not now corroborate a lifting injury if they witnessed\n it,\u201d and Howard was otherwise free to submit statements\n\fCase: 20-1880     Document: 29      Page: 4    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                             HOWARD   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n from them. Id. The court also held that the Board did not\n err in failing to address certain evidence provided by How-\n ard finding that the evidence was not relevant to whether\n Howard was injured during the lifting incident. Id. Fi-\n nally, the court found that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule,\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b), did not apply to Howard\u2019s claim be-\n cause the Board did not find that the evidence for and\n against in-service incurrence of Howard\u2019s injury was rela-\n tively equal. Id. at *4. Howard appealed.\n                          DISCUSSION\n     Our jurisdiction to review decisions of the Veterans\n Court is limited. We may review a decision of the Veterans\n Court with respect to a rule of law or interpretation of a\n statute or regulation relied on by the Veterans Court in its\n decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). However, except with re-\n spect to constitutional issues, we may not review chal-\n lenges to factual determinations or challenges to the\n application of a law or regulation to the facts of a case.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2).\n     On appeal, Howard principally argues that the Board\n and Veterans Court failed to consider relevant evidence.\n Specifically, Howard argues that the Board and Veterans\n Court failed to consider a document entitled \u201cDisposition of\n Diagnosis\u201d in his service medical records that lists \u201c7855\u201d\n as a diagnosis code related to the treatment he received in\n May 1976. Howard asserts that the code corresponds to a\n hernia diagnosis, which supports his contention that the\n cause of his May 1976 admission to the hospital for ab-\n dominal pain was a hernia, not unknown as determined by\n the Board. Howard also appears to argue that VA did not\n satisfy its duty to assist by failing adequately to investigate\n the cannon incident.\n     The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to\n review the Veterans Court\u2019s decision because Howard\n raises only factual issues on appeal. Specifically, the gov-\n ernment argues that the Board thoroughly considered the\n\fCase: 20-1880     Document: 29      Page: 5    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n HOWARD   v. WILKIE                                           5\n\n\n\n records regarding Howard\u2019s May 1976 treatment in con-\n cluding a lack of in-service incurrence of Howard\u2019s injury,\n and we lack jurisdiction to reweigh the evidence. Likewise,\n the government argues that whether VA satisfied its duty\n to assist is a factual issue that we lack authority to review.\n      We agree with the government. Regarding his May\n 1976 treatment, Howard\u2019s basic argument is that the\n Board gave too much weight to records indicating that\n Howard\u2019s abdominal pain was of \u201cunknown etiology\u201d and\n too little weight to the Disposition and Diagnosis form that\n may suggest that his condition was due to a hernia. But\n \u201c[t]he evaluation and weighing of evidence and the drawing\n of appropriate inferences from it are factual determina-\n tions committed to the discretion of the fact-finder,\u201d and we\n lack jurisdiction to reweigh evidence that has already been\n considered by the Board. Bastien v. Shinseki, 599 F.3d\n 1301, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2010). As the government points out,\n the document on which Howard relies was in the record be-\n fore the Board, and the Board is presumed to have consid-\n ered all evidence of record. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497\n F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The fact that the Board\n did not specifically refer to the document is insufficient to\n overcome this presumption.\n      With respect to Howard\u2019s argument that VA did not\n fulfill its duty to assist, we agree with the government that\n we lack jurisdiction to consider this issue. Whether VA has\n fulfilled its duty to assist is also a factual question that we\n lack jurisdiction to review. See Garrison v. Nicholson, 494\n F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, the Veterans Court\n concluded that Howard \u201chas not shown as clearly errone-\n ous the Board\u2019s determination that the duty to assist was\n satisfied,\u201d Decision, 2019 WL 5598324, at *3, and we can-\n not review the court\u2019s conclusion.\n\fCase: 20-1880   Document: 29      Page: 6    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                           HOWARD   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n     We have considered Howard\u2019s remaining arguments\n but find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing reasons, we\n dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n                      DISMISSED\n                          COSTS\n    No costs.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/702/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/210448/"], "case_name": "Howard v.

CLS Bank Int\u2019l, 573 U.S.\n 208, 216 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA\n claim falls outside \u00a7 101 where (1) it is directed to a patent-\n ineligible concept, i.e., a law of nature, natural phenome-\n non, or abstract idea, and (2), if so, the particular elements\n of the claim, considered both individually and as an or-\n dered combination, do not add enough to transform the na-\n ture of the claim into a patent-eligible application.\u201d SAP,\n 898 F.3d at 1166\u201367 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                               A\n     Under the first step of the Alice framework, the district\n court concluded that the claims of the \u2019305 patent are di-\n rected to the abstract idea of \u201ccollecting information and\n transcoding it into multiple formats.\u201d Merits Opinion, 2019\n WL 7841923, at *3. That conclusion assumes for purposes\n of eligibility analysis that, despite the \u201cat least one client\n device\u201d language, which might suggest coverage of a sys-\n tem limited to sending to a single device, the claims re-\n quire, as suggested by at least the term \u201cbroadcast,\u201d the\n ability to send to multiple devices.

Cir. 2019) (quoting\n Affinity Labs of Texas, LLC v. DIRECTV, LLC, 838 F.3d\n 1253, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2016)). In this case, the claims and\n written description make clear that the focus of the claimed\n advance is the abstract idea of format conversion, from an\n incoming signal\u2019s format to a variety of formats suited to\n different destination devices. The focus is not any specific\n advance in coding or other techniques for implementing\n that idea; no such specific technique is required.\n     The written description, through material incorporated\n by reference, itself explains the familiarity of translation of\n content\u2014from a format (including a language) of a sender\n to one suited to a recipient\u2014as a fundamental communica-\n tion practice in both the electronic and pre-electronic\n worlds. J.A. 337\u201338. We have held that the ideas of encod-\n ing and decoding image data and of converting formats, in-\n cluding when data is received from one medium and sent\n along through another, are by themselves abstract ideas,\n and accordingly concluded that claims focused on those\n general ideas governing basic communication practices,\n not on any more specific purported advance in implemen-\n tation, were directed to abstract ideas.

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board\n affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejections. We affirm the Board.\n                               I\n      The \u2019235 application, filed on October 18, 2010, involves\n fixed-pitch wind or water turbines with centrifugal weight\n control. J.A. 30. For this appeal, the application\u2019s disclo-\n sures on wind turbines are most relevant. The application\n builds on Mr. Earley\u2019s \u2019842 patent and uses that earlier pa-\n tent\u2019s \u201ccontrol solution\u201d\u2014a centrifugal-weight-control as-\n sembly.      J.A. 31.     This application describes \u201can\n implementation\u201d that \u201cextend[s] the low speed shaft down\n the length of the tower\u201d of a wind turbine. J.A. 31. Accord-\n ing to the \u2019235 application, \u201cextending the low speed shaft\n down the length of the tower also means you can move\n other major components down, including [a] generator and\n [a] gearbox,\u201d resulting \u201cin several compelling advantages.\u201d\n J.A. 31. The centrifugal-weight-control \u201cconfiguration is\n horizontal (perpendicular to [the] vertical low speed\n shaft).\u201d J.A. 32.\n     Figure 1 illustrates the wind-turbine embodiment:\n\fCase: 20-1816     Document: 26     Page: 3    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                               3\n\n\n\n\n J.A. 35.\n      The specification asserts that this configuration is an\n improvement over the prior art.

By adjusting the location of the weights\n while the overall assembly rotates, the centrifugal-weight-\n control assembly can maintain the wind turbine\u2019s operat-\n ing speed while increasing rolling torque, which allows\n generators to capture energy. Id. The general concept is\n similar to changing gears on a bike. Unlike the \u2019235 appli-\n cation, the centrifugal-weight-control assembly of the \u2019842\n patent is essentially parallel to the blades of a wind turbine\n and not connected to a vertical shaft.\n     Figure 1 shows the placement of the assembly:\n\fCase: 20-1816      Document: 26   Page: 6    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                              IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n \u2019842 patent, fig. 1.\n      Carter: \u201cWind Turbine with Governor.\u201d Carter \u201cgener-\n ally relates to a wind driven turbine assembly for driving a\n generator or generators in a manner to produce electrical\n energy in response to rotation of the wind turbine.\u201d Carter,\n col. 1, lines 6\u20139.

Simon also describes a multi-geared\n transmission, namely, \u201ca transmission 30 selectable be-\n tween at least two gear ratios, for example[,] a three (or\n more) speed transmission, coupled between the turbine 10\n for receiving wind energy and at least one generator 36 in\n the power conversion module 18.\u201d Id., \u00b6 30.\n                              B\n     On January 6, 2017, the examiner issued Mr. Earley a\n final rejection of claims 26\u201329 for obviousness over the\n combination of the \u2019842 patent, Carter, and Simon. J.A.\n 598 (Final Rejection). The examiner determined that the\n \u2019842 patent disclosed all claim elements except (1) an ex-\n tended vertical shaft, (2) a gearbox with a multi-geared\n transmission, and (3) an induction-type generator. J.A.\n 598\u201399. As to \u201can extended vertical shaft,\u201d the examiner\n concluded that \u201c[i]t would have been obvious to one skilled\n in the art at the time the invention was made to use the\n extended vertical shaft disclosed by Carter on the support-\n ing tower disclosed by [the \u2019842 patent] for the purpose of\n providing mechanical power to a generator located at the\n base of a tower.\u201d J.A. 600. As to \u201ca gearbox with a multi-\n geared transmission\u201d and \u201can induction-type generator,\u201d\n the examiner determined:\n        It would have also been obvious to one skilled\n    in the art at the time the invention was made to\n    use the multi-speed transmission (in lieu of the\n    multi-geared transmission disclosed by [the \u2019842\n    patent]) and an induction generator (in lieu of the\n    generator disclosed by [the \u2019842 patent] or the gen-\n    erator disclosed by Carter) disclosed by Simon on\n\fCase: 20-1816     Document: 26      Page: 9    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                                 9\n\n\n\n     the wind turbine disclosed by [the \u2019842 patent] for\n     the purpose of providing multiple high-speed out-\n     puts instead of a single high-speed output from the\n     transmission and providing \u201ca cost-effective ma-\n     chine for converting the rotational energy to electric-\n     ity.\u201d\n J.A. 600 (quoting Simon, \u00b6 26).\n      On November 14, 2019, the Board affirmed the exam-\n iner\u2019s rejections. Ex parte Earley, 2019 Pat. App. LEXIS\n 10527, *2 (P.T.A.B. November 14, 2019). In reaching that\n result, the Board rejected three arguments. The Board\n first explained that the \u2019842 patent\u2019s \u201cwind turbine in-\n cludes the same structural elements that [Mr. Earley] dis-\n closes are responsible for the functional limitations recited\n in claim 26\u2019s preamble.\u201d Id. at *9\u201310 (citation omitted).\n For that reason, explained the Board, \u201cthe burden was on\n [Mr. Earley] to show that [the \u2019842 patent\u2019s] wind turbine\n as modified by the suggestions in the other prior art refer-\n ences would not inherently perform the same function re-\n cited in claim 26.\u201d Id. at *10. Because Mr. Earley did not\n \u201cdirect\u201d the Board \u201cto any objective evidence,\u201d he did not\n meet the burden. Id. Next, the Board rejected Mr. Earley\u2019s\n challenge of the motivation to combine the three prior-art\n references. The Board accepted the examiner\u2019s explana-\n tion that a relevant artisan would have used the vertical\n shaft taught in Carter \u201cfor the purpose of providing me-\n chanical power to a generator located at the base of a\n tower.\u201d Id. at *5\u20136. As to Simon, the Board found that a\n relevant artisan \u201cwould have implemented an induction\n generator in [the \u2019842 patent] for the purpose of providing,\n inter alia, a cost-effective machine for converting the rota-\n tional energy to electricity.\u201d Id. at *11\u201312. Last, the Board\n rejected Mr. Earley\u2019s contention that the \u2019235 application\u2019s\n claimed invention achieves unexpected results. Id. at *12\u2013\n 13. The Board reasoned that Mr. Earley did \u201cnot direct us\n to objective, experimental data comparing the claimed\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26     Page: 10    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                             IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n invention against the closest prior art,\u201d so his argument\n was \u201cunsupported\u201d and \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d Id. at *12.\n     Mr. Earley requested a rehearing, arguing that the\n Board relied on a new ground of rejection. On January 27,\n 2020, the Board maintained its affirmance of the exam-\n iner\u2019s rejection, but because of Mr. Earley\u2019s \u201cpro se status\n and the complex nature of this prosecution,\u201d the Board\n thought it was \u201cappropriate to designate [its earlier] affir-\n mance as a new ground of rejection pursuant to 37 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 41.50(b).\u201d Ex parte Earley, Appeal 2019-000815, 2020\n WL 489476, at *3 (P.T.A.B. Jan. 27, 2020). Based on that\n designation, the Board gave Mr. Earley two options to ad-\n dress the ground: reopen prosecution or request a rehear-\n ing. Id.\n      Mr. Earley chose to request a rehearing. On March 11,\n 2020, the Board denied that (second) request for rehearing\n on the merits. Ex parte Earley, Appeal 2019-000815, 2020\n WL 1286056, at *2\u20133 (P.T.A.B. Mar. 11, 2020). Mr. Earley\n contended that Simon\u2019s induction generator could not meet\n the capability in the preamble because \u201c[a]n induction gen-\n erator with a 12 m/s rating would render the claimed in-\n vention inoperable for its intended use\u2014i.e., where [t]he\n claimed invention is unique in its ability to generate in-\n creasing amounts of energy through 24 m/s.\u201d Id. at *1 (in-\n ternal quotation marks omitted). The Board rejected that\n contention because it was \u201cnot supported by objective evi-\n dence (e.g., a sworn declaration).\u201d Id. Mr. Earley also as-\n serted that the \u2019842 patent\u2019s centrifugal-weight-control\n assembly would \u201cinherently\u201d act as \u201ca very large air brake,\u201d\n causing the capability requirement of the new application\u2019s\n preamble not to be met. Id. at *2. The Board rejected the\n assertion, stating that it was \u201cbased merely on conclusory\n statements that are not accompanied by any objective evi-\n dence (e.g., declaration evidence) providing detailed specif-\n ics of the systems used for comparison.\u201d Id.\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26       Page: 11   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                             11\n\n\n\n     Mr. Earley timely appealed.

The\n ultimate obviousness determination under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n is a matter of law based on underlying factual findings,\n which include \u201cthe scope and content of the prior art, the\n differences between the prior art and the claimed inven-\n tion, the level of ordinary skill in the art, the presence or\n absence of a motivation to combine or modify with a rea-\n sonable expectation of success, and objective indicia of non-\n obviousness.\u201d Ariosa Diagnostics v. Verinata Health, Inc.,\n 805 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2015). We review the\n Board\u2019s ultimate obviousness determination de novo and\n its underlying factual findings for substantial-evidence\n support. In re Varma, 816 F.3d 1352, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016).\n Our review for substantial-evidence support \u201cask[s]\n whether a reasonable fact finder could have arrived at the\n agency\u2019s decision, which requires examination of the record\n as a whole, taking into account evidence that both justifies\n and detracts from an agency\u2019s decision.\u201d Personal Web\n Technologies, LLC v.

Second, Mr. Earley as-\n serts that the \u2019842 patent\u2019s centrifugal-weight-control\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26      Page: 12    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                                              IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n assembly is \u201cvery different\u201d from the claimed invention and\n would not have the preamble-required capability. Op. Br.\n 8. We reject these contentions.\n     At the core of these contentions, which focus as a sub-\n stantive matter on a reasonable expectation of success, is a\n challenge to the Board\u2019s demand for objective evidence. We\n address that challenge through the framework applicable\n during prosecution (in contrast to district-court litigation).\n \u201c[T]he concept of prima facie obviousness establishes the\n framework for the obviousness determination and the bur-\n dens the parties face\u201d during patent examination. ACCO\n Brands Corp. v. Fellowes, Inc., 813 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed.\n Cir. 2016); see also In re Brandt, 886 F.3d 1171, 1176 (Fed.\n Cir. 2018) (describing the prima facie framework as well).\n \u201cUnder this framework, the patent examiner must first set\n forth a prima facie case, supported by evidence, showing\n why the claims at issue would have been obvious in light of\n the prior art.\u201d ACCO Brands, 813 F.3d at 1365. \u201cOnce the\n examiner sets out this prima facie case, the burden shifts\n to the patentee to provide evidence, in the prior art or be-\n yond it, or argument sufficient to rebut the examiner\u2019s evi-\n dence.\u201d Id. at 1365\u201366. \u201cThe examiner then reaches the\n final determination on obviousness by weighing the evi-\n dence establishing the prima facie case with the rebuttal\n evidence.\u201d Id. at 1366. \u201cIf this weighing shows obviousness\n by a preponderance of the evidence, then the claims at is-\n sue were unpatentable.\u201d Id. \u201cThis burden-shifting frame-\n work makes sense during patent examination because an\n examiner typically has no knowledge of objective consider-\n ations, and those considerations \u2018may not be available until\n years after an application is filed.\u2019\u201d In re Brandt, 886 F.3d\n at 1176.\n     \u201cThe reasonable expectation of success requirement re-\n fers to the likelihood of success in combining references to\n meet the limitations of the claimed invention.\u201d Intelligent\n Bio-Systems, Inc. v.

Mr. Earley disputes that\n finding because Simon\u2019s generator could not be physically\n combined with the \u2019842 patent. But the correct inquiry is\n not limited to \u201can actual, physical substitution of ele-\n ments\u201d; \u201cthe test for obviousness is what the combined\n teachings of the references would have suggested to\u201d a rel-\n evant artisan.

Mr. Earley repeatedly notes that Si-\n mon\u2019s specification is in miles per hour rather than meters\n per second. See Op. Br. 1 (\u201cExaminer does err when he fails\n to understand that the quantitative work found in the prior\n art of Simon is accomplished in mph (miles per hour) and\n not m/s (meters per second).\u201d); see also Op. Br. 3\u20134. To the\n extent that Mr. Earley suggests that the Board\u2019s finding\n fails because a relevant artisan would not convert the units\n from mph to m/s based on a very simple multiplicative re-\n lationship, he has not pointed to any evidence to support\n that implausible suggestion. Mr. Earley otherwise relies\n on aspects of Simon\u2019s specific induction generator, but that\n reliance does not undermine the Board\u2019s finding that a rel-\n evant artisan would alter Simon\u2019s specific generator to\n achieve the 25 m/s capability.\n                              2\n     Mr. Earley argues that the Board erred in failing to ac-\n cept his assertion that a relevant artisan would not have a\n reasonable expectation of success in using the \u2019842 patent\u2019s\n disclosure of a centrifugal weight control. Mr. Earley gives\n two reasons. We find neither sufficient to show error.\n     First, Mr. Earley asserts that using the \u2019842 patent\u2019s\n centrifugal-weight-control assembly on a vertical shaft\n would render the combination \u201cinoperable.\u201d Op. Br. 6\u20137.\n Specifically, Mr. Earley asserts that \u201c[t]he jackscrews and\n guides\u201d of the \u2019842 patent could not \u201csupport the amount of\n weight that is called for\u201d in the claimed invention. Op. Br.\n 7. The Board properly rejected this assertion as \u201cbased\n merely on conclusory statements that are not accompanied\n by any objective evidence (e.g., declaration evidence)\n providing detailed specifics of the systems used for compar-\n ison.\u201d Ex parte Earley, 2020 WL 1286056, at *2. The Board\n also properly explained that Mr. Earley\u2019s arguments about\n what the \u2019842 patent\u2019s centrifugal-weight-control assembly\n could not do relied on properties or features not actually\n required by claim 26\u2014\u201ce.g., a limitation on air brake size,\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26     Page: 15    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                             15\n\n\n\n the exclusion of an aerodynamic means, a [centrifugal-\n weight-control] diameter, ability to extend or retract\n weights totaling eight thousand pounds, or induction gen-\n erator rating.\u201d Id. at *2.\n     Second, Mr. Earley contends that a relevant artisan\n would \u201ccertainly see\u201d the centrifugal-weight-control assem-\n bly in the \u2019842 patent as an \u201cair brake\u201d that would cause a\n \u201cdrag force,\u201d preventing the combined prior art from having\n the capability required by claim 26\u2019s preamble. Op. Br. 8;\n Reply Br. 4. Like his arguments for Simon\u2019s induction gen-\n erator, Mr. Earley\u2019s contention addresses the wrong ques-\n tion. It focuses only on the specific apparatus of the \u2019842\n patent. It does not undermine the Board\u2019s finding about\n the \u2019842 patent\u2019s overall teachings on the centrifugal-\n weight-control assembly and Carter\u2019s teachings on the lo-\n cation of the assembly, among other components, at the\n base of the support staff.\n                              B\n      Mr. Earley also presents two challenges to the Board\u2019s\n inherency reasoning in finding that the combination of the\n prior-art teachings would be a structure having the capa-\n bility required by claim 26\u2019s preamble. We reject both chal-\n lenges.\n                              1\n      Mr. Earley argues that the Board issued a new ground\n of rejection when, in rejecting his second request for re-\n hearing on the merits, the Board stated: \u201calthough we ap-\n preciate that claim 26\u2019s preamble language recites a new\n capability rather than merely an intended use, this capa-\n bility was already disclosed in [the \u2019842 patent] . . . .\u201d Ex\n parte Earley, 2020 WL 1286056, at *1; Op.

Mr. Earley\n had such an opportunity in his second rehearing.\n     In its first rehearing decision, the Board specifically ex-\n plained how the examiner properly \u201cpointed out that a\n claim to an apparatus must be distinguished patentably\n from the prior art in terms of structure rather than func-\n tion\u201d\u2014the same point made in the second rehearing deci-\n sion.

A party must instead \u201cshow\n that the natural result flowing from the operation as\n taught would result in the performance of the questioned\n function.\u201d Id.\n     In the present case, the Board stated that Mr. Earley\u2019s\n own application points to certain structural features as re-\n sponsible for the preamble-required functional capability,\n that the \u2019842 patent (being combined with teachings from\n Carter and Simon) had the same structural features, and\n that the combination therefore would have the functional\n capability, unless objective evidence showed otherwise:\n          Because [the \u2019842 patent] wind turbine in-\n     cludes the same structural elements that [Mr. Ear-\n     ley\u2019s present application] discloses are responsible\n     for the functional limitations recited in claim 26\u2019s\n     preamble, the burden was on [Mr. Earley] to show\n     that [the \u2019842 patent\u2019s] wind turbine as modified by\n     the suggestions in the other prior art references\n     would not inherently perform the same function re-\n     cited in claim 26. [Mr. Earley] does not direct us to\n     any objective evidence in satisfaction of meeting\n     that burden.\n Ex parte Earley, 2019 Pat. App. LEXIS 10527, at *9\u201310.\n That inherency reasoning is proper under the prima facie\n framework.\n     Indeed, the Board needs only a \u201csound basis for believ-\n ing\u201d that the combined teachings of the prior art\u2019s structure\n results in the functional limitation. In re Spada, 911 F.2d\n 705, 708 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (\u201c[W]hen the PTO shows sound\n basis for believing that the products of the applicant and\n the prior art are the same, the applicant has the burden of\n showing that they are not.\u201d); see also In re Ikeda Food\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26      Page: 18   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18                                            IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n Research Co., Ltd., 758 F.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n                  ______________________\n\n    Before DYK, MOORE, and O\u2019MALLEY, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n      Mark Jackson appeals the decision of the United\n States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans\n Court\u201d) that dismissed his petitions for extraordinary relief\n in the nature of a writ of mandamus. We dismiss in part\n and affirm in part.\n                        BACKGROUND\n      Mr. Jackson served on active duty from July 1989 to\n July 1993. After discharge, Mr. Jackson applied for reim-\n bursement for the cost of a computer and Vocational Reha-\n bilitation and Education (\u201cVRE\u201d) benefits under Chapter\n 31, Title 38, of the United States Code. In August 2005,\n the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Regional Office\n denied Mr. Jackson\u2019s claim for reimbursement for the com-\n puter. In March 2006, the Regional Office denied Mr. Jack-\n son\u2019s claim for VRE benefits.\n     Mr. Jackson appealed the August 2005 and March\n 2006 decisions to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d).\n In a decision issued on August 4, 2014, the Board affirmed\n the denial of reimbursement for the computer but granted\n the appeal as to the VRE benefits and remanded to the Re-\n gional Office to provide VRE benefits to Mr. Jackson.\n      Between January 2015 and July 2015, the Regional Of-\n fice reopened Mr. Jackson\u2019s case and provided VRE ser-\n vices,    including by      meeting    with Mr. Jackson\n telephonically and drafting for Mr. Jackson a plan for vo-\n cational rehabilitation. After July 2015, the Regional Of-\n fice lost contact with Mr. Jackson, who did not respond to\n the Regional Office\u2019s multiple attempts to contact\n Mr. Jackson between August 2015 and January 2017. On\n April 3, 2017, the Regional Office closed Mr. Jackson\u2019s file\n\fCase: 20-1679     Document: 59     Page: 3    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n JACKSON   v. WILKIE                                        3\n\n\n\n due to Mr. Jackson\u2019s lack of response to multiple contact\n attempts.\n     On August 11, 2019, and September 8, 2019, Mr. Jack-\n son filed petitions for extraordinary relief in the nature of\n a writ of mandamus. The petitions appeared to seek en-\n forcement of the Board\u2019s 2014 remand decision with re-\n spect to VRE benefits, \u201creimbursement for a computer,\u201d\n and relief for matters not related to the implementation of\n veterans benefits provided by the VA, such as \u201can order re-\n storing his Florida truck driver\u2019s license.\u201d App\u2019x 1. 1\n     The Veterans Court determined that it had jurisdiction\n only over Mr. Jackson\u2019s petitions to enforce the Board\u2019s Au-\n gust 2014 decision. The Veterans Court further deter-\n mined that because the Regional Office had reopened\n Mr. Jackson\u2019s VRE case and provided services, \u201cthe relief\n requested in his petitions [had] been provided,\u201d and there\n was no continuing case or controversy that the Veterans\n Court had jurisdiction over. App\u2019x 2. The Veterans Court\n accordingly dismissed Mr. Jackson\u2019s petitions as moot.\n     Mr. Jackson appeals.\n                         DISCUSSION\n      First, we conclude that we have no jurisdiction over\n Mr. Jackson\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of his petitions as\n moot. We have limited jurisdiction to review appeals of de-\n cisions by the Veterans Court. Wanless v. Shinseki, 618\n F.3d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Except to the extent that\n an appeal presents a constitutional issue, we may not re-\n view a challenge to a factual determination by the Veterans\n Court. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Mr. Jackson contends that\n his petitions are not moot, arguing that the delay between\n the original Regional Office decisions in 2005 and 2006 and\n\n\n\n     1 \u201cApp\u2019x\u201d refers to the appendix attached to the gov-\n ernment\u2019s response brief.\n\fCase: 20-1679     Document: 59      Page: 4    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                             JACKSON   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n the Board decision in 2014 \u201cput [him] in the position where\n . . . [he had] too many college credits to transfer to another\n school.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Mem. in Lieu Oral Arg. 1\u20133. This is a\n challenge to the Veterans Court\u2019s factual determination\n that the Regional Office had complied with the Board\u2019s\n 2014 remand order, which we have no jurisdiction to re-\n view. Mr. Jackson also argues that his petitions for en-\n forcement of the Board\u2019s 2014 remand order raises\n questions under the Fourteenth Amendment, but his\n \u201ccharacterization of that question as constitutional in na-\n ture does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise\n lack.\u201d Flores v. Nicholson, 476 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir.\n 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Helfer v.\n West, 174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).\n     Second, we affirm the dismissal of Mr. Jackson\u2019s ap-\n peal of the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal of the writ as to the\n reimbursement for a computer. \u201cThis court has jurisdiction\n to review the [Veterans Court\u2019s] decision whether to grant\n a mandamus petition that raises a non-frivolous legal ques-\n tion . . . .\u201d Beasley v. Shinseki, 709 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed.\n Cir. 2013). In our review, \u201cwe may determine whether the\n petitioner has satisfied the legal standard for issuing the\n writ.\u201d Id. To obtain mandamus, Mr. Jackson must show\n that he \u201ccannot adequately protect his rights through the\n normal appellate process.\u201d Lamb v. Principi, 284 F.3d\n 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \u201c[T]he extraordinary writs\n cannot be used as substitutes for appeals . . . .\u201d Id. (altera-\n tion in original) (citation omitted). Mr. Jackson\u2019s reim-\n bursement claim for a computer has not been properly\n appealed, and mandamus cannot be used \u201cas a substitute\n for the regular appeals process.\u201d Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct.\n for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2004).\n     Third, we affirm as to the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal\n of the petitions seeking relief for claims that do not relate\n to implementation of veterans benefits.          We review\n whether the Veterans Court \u201cproperly declined to assert ju-\n risdiction\u201d de novo. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1358\n\fCase: 20-1679     Document: 59      Page: 5   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n JACKSON   v. WILKIE                                         5\n\n\n\n (Fed. Cir. 2002). \u201c[T]he Veterans Court has jurisdiction to\n review Secretary decisions, appealed from the Board, made\n \u2018under a law\u2019 affecting the provision of [VA-provided] bene-\n fits.\u201d Burris v. Wilkie, 888 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\n The Veterans Court correctly determined here that it\n lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Jackson\u2019s claims that do not\n relate to implementation of veterans benefits.\n                         CONCLUSION\n    We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the appeal of the Vet-\n erans Court\u2019s mootness decision. We affirm the Veterans\n Court in all other respects.\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART\n                            COSTS\n     No costs.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/175105/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/210787/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/763546/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/777085/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/136997/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/778979/"], "case_name": "Jackson v.

Ap-\n pellant Mary A. Paredez appeals the decision of the United\n States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissing in\n part and affirming in part her appeal from the Board of\n Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision denying (1) entitlement to an\n initial disability rating in excess of 40 percent for fibrom-\n yalgia on a schedular or an extraschedular basis; (2) a dis-\n ability rating in excess of 50 percent for dysthymic disorder\n with anxiety; (3) an effective date earlier than Novem-\n ber 27, 2015, for the award of entitlement to disability com-\n pensation for fibromyalgia; and (4) a total disability rating\n based on individual unemployability (TDIU). Paredez v.\n Wilkie, No. 19-5401, 2020 WL 3163606 (Vet. App. June 15,\n 2020) (Memorandum Decision). For the reasons discussed\n below, we dismiss-in-part and affirm-in-part.\n                               I\n      Ms. Paredez served on active duty in the U.S. Army\n from December 1982 to December 1990. Immediately fol-\n lowing her discharge from military service, Ms. Paredez\n filed a claim for disability compensation for fibromyalgia.\n A VA regional office (RO) denied disability compensation\n for fibromyalgia in July 1991. That decision was not ap-\n pealed and became final.\n     In April 2012, the RO awarded entitlement to disability\n compensation for dysthymic disorder with anxiety and as-\n signed a 30 percent disability rating effective from April\n 2011. In June 2016, Ms. Paredez submitted a statement\n from her physician which indicated that Ms. Paredez had\n to retire from her job in the postal service because of her\n fibromyalgia. VA also received records reflecting a denial\n\fCase: 20-2062      Document: 18     Page: 3   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE                                         3\n\n\n\n of her Social Security disability claim based on fibromyal-\n gia and other claimed conditions. Memorandum Decision\n at *1\u20132.\n     The RO issued a rating decision in July 2016 awarding\n entitlement to disability compensation for fibromyalgia\n with a 40 percent disability rating and increasing the rat-\n ing for dysthymic disorder with anxiety from 30 percent to\n 50 percent, both effective November 2015. Ms. Paredez ap-\n pealed, and the RO denied entitlement to a disability rat-\n ing in excess of 50 percent for dysthymic disorder with\n anxiety, a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for fi-\n bromyalgia, an earlier effective date, service connection for\n fibromyalgia, and TDIU. Ms. Paredez appealed that deci-\n sion to the Board. On July 16, 2019, the Board also denied\n those entitlements. The Board also found that Ms. Paredez\n had raised an issue of clear and unmistakable error (CUE)\n in prior rating decisions and referred the matter to the\n agency for a determination. Id. at *2.\n     Ms. Paredez appealed to the Veterans Court, which af-\n firmed the Board\u2019s decision, including the Board\u2019s denial of\n a higher rating for fibromyalgia on an extraschedular basis.\n The Veterans Court dismissed the portions of\n Ms. Paredez\u2019s appeal concerning the Board\u2019s denial of enti-\n tlement to an increased disability rating for fibromyalgia\n on a schedular basis and the issue of CUE. Id. at *1.\n Ms. Paredez timely appealed to this court.\n                               II\n     The scope of this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions\n by the Veterans Court is narrow. We may review decisions\n by the Veterans Court \u201con a rule of law or of any statute or\n regulation . . . or any interpretation thereof (other than a\n determination as to a factual matter)\u201d that the Veterans\n Court relied on in making its decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a).\n But this court lacks jurisdiction to review \u201ca challenge to a\n factual determination\u201d or the application of law to fact un-\n less the appeal presents a constitutional issue. 38 U.S.C.\n\fCase: 20-2062    Document: 18     Page: 4    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                           PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2); see also Cook v. Principi, 353 F.3d 937, 939\n (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n                              A\n     Ms. Paredez states in her informal opening brief and\n reply brief that her appeal challenges the Veterans Court\u2019s\n interpretation of a statute, regulation, or constitutional\n provision. Appellant\u2019s Br. 2. 1 However, Ms. Paredez does\n not identify which rules of law, statutes, regulations, or\n constitutional provisions the Veterans Court relied upon.\n And the Veterans Court\u2019s decision she appeals from does\n not appear to concern the interpretation of any of the same.\n Instead, the Veterans Court reviewed the Board\u2019s factual\n determinations concerning the proper effective date and\n disability ratings, including entitlement to TDIU and ex-\n traschedular evaluations, for clear error and applied estab-\n lished law to the particular facts of Ms. Paredez\u2019s case.\n Memorandum Decision at *4\u20137. In so doing, the Veterans\n Court did not elaborate on the meaning of any rule of law,\n statute, or regulation. We cannot exercise jurisdiction\n without such an issue of legal interpretation to review.\n Githens v. Shinseki, 676 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n Because Ms. Paredez\u2019s appeal raises only factual issues as\n to the Veterans Court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s denial of\n entitlement to a higher rating for fibromyalgia on an ex-\n traschedular basis, a higher rating for dysthymic disorder,\n an earlier effective date, and TDIU, we dismiss that portion\n of her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n                              B\n    Additionally, we liberally construe Ms. Paredez\u2019s infor-\n mal briefs to challenge the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal of\n\n\n    1   Citations to Ms. Paredez\u2019s informal brief and reply\n brief (and the pages and documents included therein) re-\n flect the pagination applied by this court\u2019s electronic case\n files system, Docket Nos. 3 and 10, respectively.\n\fCase: 20-2062      Document: 18    Page: 5    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE                                        5\n\n\n\n the portion of her appeal concerning the Board\u2019s denial of\n entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of\n 40 percent on a schedular basis. Appellant\u2019s Br. 2\u20133. In\n dismissing that part of her appeal, the Veterans Court did\n not cite to or elaborate on the meaning of any legal provi-\n sion, but simply applied the well-established jurispruden-\n tial rule that issues not raised by an appellant are\n considered abandoned. Memorandum Decision at *1.\n     Ms. Paredez asserts that she could not have abandoned\n her appeal of the Board\u2019s denial of entitlement to a higher\n rating for fibromyalgia on a schedular basis because the\n Veterans Court recited that claim in its summary of the\n Board decision being appealed from. Appellant\u2019s Br. 2\u20133;\n Memorandum Decision at *1. However, merely appealing\n from a decision does not raise every issue in that decision\n on appeal. In order to adequately raise an argument, an\n appellant must develop the argument before the Veterans\n Court. We have repeatedly affirmed the Veterans Court\u2019s\n application of this maxim in dismissing veterans\u2019 appeals\n where, as here, even after liberally interpreting an appel-\n lant\u2019s informal brief, the Veterans Court can discern no ar-\n gument regarding an issue. See e.g., Gaines v. McDonald,\n 589 Fed. Appx. 993, 995 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Andre v. Prin-\n cipi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1362\u201363 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n      Liberally construed, Ms. Paredez\u2019s informal briefs chal-\n lenge only the Veterans Court\u2019s application of that princi-\n ple to the facts of her case. However, we lack jurisdiction\n to review the application of law to facts. 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the\n Veterans Court\u2019s determination that Ms. Paredez had\n abandoned the issue of entitlement to an increased disabil-\n ity rating for fibromyalgia on a schedular basis and we dis-\n miss that portion of her appeal.\n                              C\n     Finally, Ms. Paredez argues that the Veterans Court\n erred by concluding it lacked jurisdiction to review her\n\fCase: 20-2062    Document: 18       Page: 6    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                             PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n claim of CUE. Appellant\u2019s Br. 3. We have jurisdiction to\n review the Veterans Court\u2019s determination that it lacked\n jurisdiction over Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim because that\n challenge concerns the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of\n its jurisdictional statute, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7252(a). Andre,\n 301 F.3d at 1358.\n     We find that the Veterans Court properly determined\n that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim\n because the Board referred that claim to the agency and\n the Veterans Court has jurisdiction to \u201creview referred\n matters only to the extent that the appellant argues that\n remand, rather than referral, was appropriate.\u201d Memoran-\n dum Decision at *1. The Board has not yet decided\n Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim\u2014instead, that claim has been re-\n ferred to the agency for further development. The Veterans\n Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to reviewing final decisions\n of the Board. Howard v. Gober, 220 F.3d 1341, 1344\n (Fed. Cir. 2000). If VA ultimately concludes that CUE does\n not exist as to the relevant prior rating decisions,\n Ms. Paredez may appeal that determination to the Board\n at that time. We therefore affirm the Veterans Court\u2019s dis-\n missal of Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim for lack of jurisdiction.\n                              III\n      Because we lack jurisdiction to review the issues raised\n by Ms. Paredez in her appeal, we dismiss as to: 1) the Vet-\n erans Court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s denial of entitle-\n ment to a higher initial disability rating for fibromyalgia\n on an extraschedular basis, a higher disability rating for\n dysthymic disorder with anxiety, an earlier effective date\n for the award of entitlement to disability compensation for\n fibromyalgia, and TDIU; and 2) the Veterans Court\u2019s dis-\n missal of her appeal as to the Board\u2019s denial of entitlement\n to a higher disability rating for fibromyalgia on a schedular\n basis. We affirm the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal of\n Ms. Paredez\u2019s appeal concerning the issue of CUE.\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART\n\fCase: 20-2062      Document: 18    Page: 7   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n PAREDEZ   v.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n                  ______________________\n\n    Before NEWMAN, LOURIE, and HUGHES, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n     Paul Wright, a veteran of the United States Navy, ap-\n peals the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for\n Veterans Claims in Wright v. Wilkie, No. 19-5244, 2019 WL\n 6138462 (Vet. App. Nov. 20, 2019) (Decision). Appellant\u2019s\n Br. 3\u20135. 1 The Veterans Court found that there was an\n available alternative means to secure Mr. Wright\u2019s re-\n quested relief because his claims were still pending before\n the Department of Veterans Affairs and therefore denied\n his petition for a writ of mandamus. Id. Mr. Wright argues\n that, in denying his petition, the Board impermissibly ap-\n plied the All Writs Act (AWA) and violated his constitu-\n tional right of petition under the First Amendment.\n Because we have jurisdiction only to review legal questions\n appealed from the Veterans Court and because we disagree\n with Mr. Wright\u2019s legal arguments, we affirm.\n                               I\n     Mr. Wright served in the U.S. Navy three times be-\n tween April 1974 and July 1984. S.A. 71. In 2015, he filed\n a claim with VA for multiple disability benefits, including\n a deviated septum (DS), obstructed sleep apnea (OSA), and\n gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). S.A. 74\u201391. VA\n awarded Mr. Wright service connection for DS with a max-\n imum 10 percent rating for that claim, but VA did not reach\n a final decision regarding service connection for his other\n claims of OSA and GERD because the agency was in the\n\n\n\n    1   Citations to Mr. Wright\u2019s informal brief and reply\n (and the pages and documents included therein) reflect the\n pagination applied by this court\u2019s electronic case files sys-\n tem, Docket Nos. 2 and 14, respectively.\n\fCase: 20-1982     Document: 26      Page: 3    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n WRIGHT   v.

S.A. 37\u201338; S.A. 71\u201373.\n     Mr. Wright filed a \u201cpetition for extraordinary individ-\n ual equitable relief\u201d with the Veterans Court, arguing that\n VA had \u201cimplicitly\u201d decided his OSA and GERD claims by\n deciding his DS claim and that VA was unlawfully with-\n holding those benefits. S.A. 11\u201319. The Veterans Court\n construed the petition as a \u201cpetition for extraordinary relief\n in the nature of a writ of mandamus under 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2).\u201d S.A. 20.\n     The Veterans Court denied the petition. Decision at *2.\n The Veterans Court held that it could not issue a writ of\n mandamus under the All Writs Act (AWA) unless Mr.\n Wright could demonstrate, among other things, \u201cthe lack\n of adequate alternative means to obtain the desired relief.\u201d\n Id. at *1 (citing Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 367,\n 380\u201381 (2004)). Finding \u201cMr. Wright\u2019s OSA and GERD\n claims\u201d to be \u201cstill pending with VA,\u201d the Veterans Court\n held that he had \u201calternative means for relief . . . available\n to him.\u201d Id. at *2.\n     Mr. Wright subsequently appealed to this court.\n                               II\n     We have limited jurisdiction over appeals from the Vet-\n erans Court. We decide \u201call relevant questions of law, in-\n cluding interpreting constitutional and statutory\n provisions.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). But except to the extent\n that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, we may not\n review a challenge to a factual determination or a chal-\n lenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a case.\n Id. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); see Wanless v. Shinseki, 618 F.3d 1333,\n 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010). In matters over which we have juris-\n diction, we must set aside any interpretation that is \u201c(A)\n arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional\n right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of\n\fCase: 20-1982     Document: 26       Page: 4   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                              WRIGHT   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or in viola-\n tion of a statutory right; or (D) without observance of pro-\n cedure required by law.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). We review\n the Veterans Court\u2019s legal determinations under a de novo\n standard. Prenzler v. Derwinski, 928 F.2d 392, 393\n (Fed. Cir. 1991). When a denial of a petition for a writ of\n mandamus raises a \u201cnon-frivolous legal question,\u201d Beasley\n v. Shinseki, 709 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2013), we review\n the denial for abuse of discretion. See Hargrove v. Shinseki,\n 629 F.3d 1377, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Lamb v. Principi, 284\n F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n                               III\n      Two statutes are at issue in this case, 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2) and the AWA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). Mr. Wright\n argues that the Veterans Court should have applied\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2), without invoking the AWA, to compel action\n by the VA Secretary to pay his claims. See Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 1 (\u201c[T]he AWA simply does not apply.\u201d) The applicability of\n the AWA is a legal question over which we have jurisdic-\n tion. Because, as explained below, we read the AWA and\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2) together, we hold that the Veterans Court\u2019s in-\n terpretation of the AWA was proper.\n      The AWA enables federal courts to \u201cissue all writs nec-\n essary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic-\n tions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). Section 7261(a)(2) defines the\n scope of review of the Veterans Court as including \u201ccom-\n pel[ling] action of the Secretary unlawfully withheld or un-\n reasonably delayed.\u201d Together, these provisions give the\n Veterans Court power to issue writs of mandamus when\n the Secretary is unlawfully withholding a veteran\u2019s bene-\n fits.

Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals\n Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985) for the proposition that the\n AWA functions only as a gap-filler and does not apply\n whenever \u201ca statute specifically addresses the particular\n issue at hand.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 1. Mr. Wright contends that\n because \u00a7 7261(a)(2) partially addresses a situation where\n the Secretary is withholding benefits, the AWA cannot ap-\n ply as well. Id. But Pa. Bureau stands for the proposition\n that when another statute specifically limits the reach of a\n court\u2019s power, the AWA does not circumvent that limit. 474\n U.S. at 43. Cases reading the AWA in conjunction with\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2) do not conflict with that principle.\n     Thus, because the Veterans Court followed our and the\n Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in considering the AWA to-\n gether with \u00a7 7261(a)(2), we affirm.\n                              IV\n     Because we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual\n determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as\n applied to the facts of a particular case,\u201d we lack jurisdic-\n tion to consider Mr. Wright\u2019s remaining arguments. 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).\n     Mr. Wright argues that, by \u201crefusing to issue a merits\n decision,\u201d the Veterans Court \u201cimplicitly\u201d held that he does\n \u201cnot have a fundamental right to petition for redress of\n [his] grievances as to the Secretary\u2019s unlawful withholding\n of veteran benefits to which [he is] presently entitled,\u201d pur-\n suant to the \u201cPetition Clause of the First Amendment.\u201d Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Br. 1.\n     Although framed as a constitutional question, this ar-\n gument is really a restatement of the merits of his case be-\n fore the Veterans Court. The Veterans Court applied the\n AWA to the facts of Mr. Wright\u2019s case by denying\n Mr. Wright\u2019s petition because he had adequate alternative\n\fCase: 20-1982    Document: 26      Page: 6    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                            WRIGHT   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n means to obtain his desired relief. Decision at *3.\n Mr. Wright argues that this holding was incorrect because\n the Veterans Court incorrectly determined that he had\n missed medical examinations necessary to his pending VA\n claims. See Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 11\u201316. We have no juris-\n diction over these questions of fact or application of law to\n fact. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Mr. Wright\u2019s argument that he\n has been denied constitutional rights reiterates these\n points. See Appellant\u2019s Br. 1 (arguing that VA\u2019s \u201cunlawful\n withholding\u201d of benefits \u201cimplicitly\u201d violates the constitu-\n tion). Although we have jurisdiction to consider constitu-\n tional questions, appellants must do more than state that\n improper application of law to fact in the Veterans Court\n implicitly violates the constitution. See Helfer v. West, 174\n F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (an appellant\u2019s \u201ccharacter-\n ization of [a] question as constitutional in nature does not\n confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack\u201d). Be-\n cause the Veterans Court decision did not make any deci-\n sion regarding the First Amendment, even implicitly, we\n have no jurisdiction to consider this argument.\n                              V\n     In this appeal, the only issue over which we have juris-\n diction is whether the AWA applies to Mr. Wright\u2019s petition\n for a writ of mandamus. Because we hold that \u00a7 7261(a)(2)\n must be read in conjunction with the AWA under these cir-\n cumstances, we affirm the Veterans Court\u2019s decision that\n it does.\n                        AFFIRMED\n No costs.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/136997/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/175105/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/557449/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/182329/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/777085/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111538/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/763546/"], "case_name": "Wright v.

In re\n Coles, No. 87570785, 2019 WL 5290188 (T.T.A.B. Sept. 26,\n 2019). Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s\n conclusion, we affirm.\n                       I. BACKGROUND\n     On August 16, 2017, Coles filed an application seeking\n registration on the principal register of \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d\n in standard characters. He identified the services as:\n     Entertainment services, namely, on-line non-\n     downloadable videos, in the field of beer, beer ac-\n     cessories and the beer industry; provision of enter-\n     tainment, namely, on-line non-downloadable\n     videos concerning beer, beer accessories and the\n     beer industry.\n J.A. 223. With his application, Coles included still images\n from a video, entitled \u201c5 Last Minute Gift Ideas That Won\u2019t\n Cut Into Your Beer Fund,\u201d that can be found on his web-\n site. J.A. 37\u201348.\n     Over three non-final office actions and a final office ac-\n tion, the examining attorney refused to register the mark,\n finding that it was merely descriptive of a feature of the\n identified services. See J.A. 51\u201382, 97\u2013180, 201\u201304,\n 226\u201379. In the final office action, issued January 9, 2019,\n the examining attorney distilled the issue. \u201cBrew,\u201d as de-\n fined by Merriam-Webster\u2019s Online Dictionary, means \u201ca\n brewed beverage (such as beer).\u201d J.A. 227 (quoting J.A.\n 232). \u201cScience,\u201d as defined by The American Heritage Dic-\n tionary of the English Language, means \u201c[a] systematic\n method or body of knowledge in a given area.\u201d J.A. 227\n (quoting J.A. 235). In light of these definitions, the exam-\n ining attorney concluded a consumer would understand\n \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d as describing \u201ca body of knowledge\n about beer or preparing beer.\u201d J.A. 228. And the\n\fCase: 20-1236      Document: 33      Page: 3     Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: COLES                                                    3\n\n\n\n examining attorney found that the record, including nu-\n merous online videos and websites, established that \u201ccon-\n sumers who brew and consume beer commonly use the\n wording \u2018BREW SCIENCE\u2019 to describe information about\n beer and preparing beer.\u201d J.A. 228.\n     The examining attorney further found that the descrip-\n tion of Coles\u2019 videos on his website confirmed that the mark\n is merely descriptive of the described services. The website\n explains that it is \u201c[a] beer show\u201d that \u201cdo[es] sciencey type\n stuff like experiments.\u201d Id. And, the website represents,\n \u201c[w]e are committed to ensuring that no beer-related query\n (a buery, if you will) goes un-answered.\u201d Id.\n     Coles appealed to the Board. Coles acknowledged that\n \u201cbrew\u201d is a slang term for beer. Coles focused his argu-\n ment, instead, on a contention that the \u201cvideo services are\n comedic in nature and not scientific.\u201d J.A. 302. Given the\n allegedly comedic nature of Coles\u2019 videos, he claimed that\n the \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d mark is \u201cplayful and fanciful in the\n context of its services.\u201d Id.\n     The examining attorney, in her appeal brief before the\n Board, cited several pieces of evidence to establish that\n \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d is descriptive. She presented diction-\n ary definitions of \u201cbrew\u201d and \u201cscience,\u201d numerous online\n sources using the phrase, and statements on Coles\u2019 website\n describing the videos as relating to \u201csciencey type stuff.\u201d\n     The Board found that the record established the defini-\n tion of \u201cbrew\u201d as a \u201cbrewed beverage (such as beer).\u201d Coles,\n 2019 WL 5290188, at *5. The Board further found that the\n record established the definition of \u201cscience\u201d as \u201ca system-\n atic method or body of knowledge in a given area.\u201d Id. In\n the context of Coles\u2019 services, it concluded, \u201c\u2018science\u2019 . . . de-\n scribes a body of knowledge about beer or brewing beer.\u201d\n Id. The Board also found that the evidence tended to show\n that \u201cbrew science\u201d is used in the beer industry to discuss\n beer knowledge. Id. at *6.\n\fCase: 20-1236     Document: 33     Page: 4    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                                 IN RE: COLES\n\n\n\n\n      The Board therefore held that \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d is \u201ca\n merely descriptive term related to a body of knowledge\n about beer or brewing beer.\u201d Id. at *7. And, when used in\n connection with Coles\u2019 identified entertainment services,\n \u201cit immediately tells consumers about a feature of those\n services, namely, that the entertainment provided in the\n form of non-downloadable videos featuring beer and the\n beer industry includes videos related to the science of beer,\n or BREW SCIENCE.\u201d Id. The Board thus affirmed the\n examining attorney\u2019s refusal to register \u201cBREW\n SCIENCE.\u201d Id. at *8.\n     Coles appeals the Board\u2019s decision. We have jurisdic-\n tion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(B).\n                         II. ANALYSIS\n     The Lanham Act precludes registration of a mark that\n \u201cwhen used on or in connection with the goods of the appli-\n cant is merely descriptive . . . of them.\u201d 15 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1052(e)(1). \u201cA term is merely descriptive if it immedi-\n ately conveys knowledge of a quality, feature, function, or\n characteristic of the goods or services with which it is\n used.\u201d In re Bayer AG, 488 F.3d 960, 963 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n \u201cA mark may be merely descriptive even if it does not de-\n scribe the \u2018full scope and extent\u2019 of the applicant\u2019s goods or\n services.\u201d In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171,\n 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n       The Board\u2019s determination that a mark is merely de-\n scriptive is a factual finding, which we review for substan-\n tial evidence support. In re TriVita, Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874\n (Fed. Cir. 2015). \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018means such rele-\n vant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as ade-\n quate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d In re Bayer AG, 488 F.3d\n at 964 (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197,\n 229 (1938)). Given this deferential standard, \u201cwe may not\n reverse the Board\u2019s decision for lack of substantial evidence\n . . . so long as competent evidence in the record supports\n\fCase: 20-1236     Document: 33     Page: 5    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: COLES                                                5\n\n\n\n the Board\u2019s ruling.\u201d DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro\n Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1252 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n     Coles\u2019 arguments on appeal amount to one overarching\n contention: the Board\u2019s decision lacks substantial evidence\n support. For the reasons discussed below, we disagree.\n     Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that\n \u201cbrew\u201d refers to beer. See Coles, 2019 WL 5290188, at *5.\n The Board cited two dictionaries and multiple definitions.\n Id. at *2. That evidence is substantial evidence supporting\n the Board\u2019s conclusion. The fact that, as Coles contends,\n \u201cbrew\u201d can also refer to, inter alia, the brewing of tea, does\n not detract from the conclusion that brew is a commonly\n accepted term for beer and that, in the context of entertain-\n ment services related to beer, a consumer would reasona-\n bly understand the term to refer to beer.\n     Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s finding\n that \u201cscience\u201d refers generally to \u201ca systematic method or\n body of knowledge in a given area,\u201d and specifically, in the\n context of Coles\u2019 mark, to \u201ca body of knowledge about beer\n or brewing beer.\u201d Id. at *5. The Board supported its con-\n clusion with multiple dictionary definitions. Id. at *2. The\n Board further explained that Coles\u2019 own website, which de-\n scribes his videos as containing \u201csciencey type stuff,\u201d in-\n cluding experimenting with different beer combinations,\n confirmed its understanding. Id. at *5. Given this, the\n Board rejected Coles\u2019 contention that \u201cscience\u201d was used in\n a merely \u201cplayful\u201d manner to describe the videos. Id. On\n appeal, Coles again argues that \u201cscience\u201d is used in a come-\n dic fashion. But, as the Board aptly observed, Coles\u2019 de-\n scribed services are broad enough to encompass \u201cproviding\n non-downloadable videos concerning the science of beer\n and the science of brewing beer.\u201d Id. That his specific prod-\n uct is comedic does not overcome the fact that the specified\n services are not so limited.\n     Finally, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s find-\n ing that the mark \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d is descriptive of\n\fCase: 20-1236     Document: 33     Page: 6    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                                 IN RE: COLES\n\n\n\n\n Coles\u2019 identified services. The Board found that the terms\n \u201cbrew\u201d and \u201cscience,\u201d when combined, retain their descrip-\n tive significance. Id. at *6. The Board cited numerous\n online sources using the term \u201cbrew science.\u201d Id. at *2\u20135.\n It concluded that those sources establish that \u201cbrew sci-\n ence\u201d is \u201cused in the beer industry, by home brewers, by\n educational institutions, by bloggers and on websites in\n discussing beer, including the brewing of beer, and making\n craft brews.\u201d Id. at *6. Coles\u2019 own website, moreover,\n clearly describes his videos as relating to the knowledge of\n beer. The Board, citing this evidence, concluded that\n \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d was just as descriptive as its individual\n components. Id. Given the extensive evidence cited by the\n Board, we hold that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by\n substantial evidence.\n      Coles argues that the Patent and Trademark Office has\n previously registered several marks containing the term\n \u201cscience\u201d for entertainment services. He contends that this\n creates precedent that \u201cscience\u201d is not descriptive of enter-\n tainment services. Appellant\u2019s Br. 13\u201314. We disagree. A\n list of marks containing \u201cscience\u201d is, at best, probative and\n does not overcome the substantial evidence cited by the\n Board that establishes the descriptiveness of \u201cBREW\n SCIENCE\u201d in relation to the specific services at issue in\n this case. We note, moreover, that Coles provides us with\n a bare list of marks containing \u201cscience.\u201d Such a list estab-\n lishes nothing of relevance to this case, as there is no basis\n for us to assume that the cited marks are themselves in-\n herently distinctive.\n                         CONCLUSION\n     We have considered Coles\u2019 remaining arguments and\n find them unpersuasive.

DVA\n\n\n\n PER CURIAM.\n      Appellant Jennifer L. Miller was removed from her po-\n sition as a licensed practical nurse (\u201cLPN\u201d) with the De-\n partment of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d) for failing to\n maintain her LPN license. She appealed her removal to\n the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d), which\n upheld her removal. We affirm.\n                                I\n     Between 2014 and 2019, Ms. Miller was employed as\n an LPN at a DVA medical facility. A condition of her em-\n ployment as an LPN was that she maintain her LPN li-\n cense. In 2018, she was given a courtesy notice by the DVA\n that her LPN license was about to expire. She renewed her\n license that year on the day before her license was set to\n expire.\n      In August 2019, shortly before Ms. Miller\u2019s license was\n set to expire, the DVA again gave her a courtesy notice that\n her license was about to expire. This time, Ms. Miller did\n not renew her license, and it expired on September 5, 2019.\n The DVA subsequently proposed to remove her from her\n position because of her failure to maintain her LPN license.\n      At the time her license expired, Ms. Miller was on\n leave-without-pay status. In the notice of proposed re-\n moval, the agency proposed to detail her to a non-LPN po-\n sition if and when she returned to work. The notice stated:\n \u201cYour supervisor will give you a detail assignment when/if\n you return to duty. You will be detailed while the proposed\n removal is in process, i.e., until the proposed removal has\n been decided.\u201d\n     Ms. Miller never returned to work. Through a repre-\n sentative, she made an oral response to the proposed re-\n moval and supported that response with documentation.\n The agency subsequently removed her, effective October\n 22, 2019, for failure to maintain her LPN license. In the\n removal decision, the deciding official sustained the charge\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25    Page: 3    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n MILLER   v. DVA                                            3\n\n\n\n of failure to maintain a current, full, and unrestricted li-\n cense as a licensed practical nurse.\n     Ms. Miller appealed the removal action to the Board.\n She waived her right to a hearing before an administrative\n judge, and the case was decided based on the parties\u2019 writ-\n ten submissions.\n     The administrative judge who was assigned to the case\n upheld the removal action in a comprehensive opinion. The\n administrative judge noted that maintaining LPN licen-\n sure was a condition of Ms. Miller\u2019s employment as an LPN\n and that it was her responsibility to ensure that she re-\n mained licensed throughout her employment with the\n DVA.\n     In her presentation to the administrative judge, Ms.\n Miller contended that because she was on leave at the time\n her license expired, she was not able to access the agency\u2019s\n training resources. The administrative judge found, how-\n ever, that Ms. Miller had complete access to the agency\u2019s\n computer systems and her workplace prior to the time she\n was removed. Moreover, the administrative judge con-\n cluded that even if Ms. Miller did not have access to her\n workplace during the period prior to the expiration of her\n license, the agency could not be held responsible for that\n lack of access because Ms. Miller entered leave status at\n her own request. The administrative judge also found that\n Ms. Miller could have satisfied the requirements for her li-\n cense renewal by accessing training resources from outside\n the agency.\n      Before the administrative judge, Ms. Miller claimed\n that the agency\u2019s decision to remove her was the product of\n discrimination based on a chronic disability. The adminis-\n trative judge rejected that claim, finding that Ms. Miller\n did not establish that her disability was a factor in her re-\n moval. The administrative judge also found that Ms. Mil-\n ler failed to prove that the agency\u2019s decision to remove her\n constituted unlawful reprisal based on (1) an equal-\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25      Page: 4     Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                                   MILLER   v. DVA\n\n\n\n employment-opportunity complaint she filed against the\n agency in 2018, (2) her use of leave under the Family and\n Medical Leave Act, and (3) acts of whistleblowing on her\n part.\n    Ms. Miller petitioned this court for review of the ad-\n ministrative judge\u2019s decision. 1\n                                II\n     At the outset, the government argues that we must dis-\n miss the petition in this case because Ms. Miller has not\n unequivocally abandoned her discrimination claim, and\n thus this is a \u201cmixed case\u201d that is outside the scope of our\n jurisdiction. See Perry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 137 S. Ct.\n 1975, 1977 (2017). We disagree.\n     While Ms. Miller lodged a complaint of discrimination\n against the agency in 2018, that complaint was not related\n to her removal, which occurred a year later. And while she\n asserted before the administrative judge in this case that\n her removal was the product of disability discrimination\n and reprisal for equal employment opportunity activity,\n\n\n\n     1    Ms. Miller argues that the government\u2019s brief was\n untimely filed and that it should be rejected as a result. We\n hold that the government\u2019s brief was timely under the rules\n of this court. Ms. Miller\u2019s brief was filed on June 23, 2020,\n and the certified list of the materials constituting the rec-\n ord was received by the court on June 25, 2020. Pursuant\n to Fed. Cir. R. 31(e)(2), the government\u2019s brief was due for\n filing 21 days after the filing of the certified list, on July 16,\n 2020. The government\u2019s brief was filed on that day. Ap-\n parently, the brief was mailed to Ms. Miller\u2019s prior address.\n See App. 124. On August 17, 2020, the government\u2019s brief\n was served on Ms. Miller at the proper address. The min-\n isterial error in initially serving Ms. Miller at an outdated\n address does not justify rejecting the government\u2019s brief.\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25     Page: 5   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n MILLER   v. DVA                                             5\n\n\n\n she has abandoned those claims on appeal and is pressing\n only issues over which this court has jurisdiction.\n     In her statement pursuant to Fed. Cir. R. 15(c), Ms.\n Miller represented that no claim of discrimination has been\n or will be raised in this case and that any claim of discrim-\n ination raised before and decided by the Board \u201chas been\n abandoned or will not be raised or continued in this or any\n other court.\u201d In addition, in her reply brief Ms. Miller\n stated unequivocally that she is waiving her discrimination\n claims in this action and that her claim pending before the\n Equal Employment Opportunity Commission does not re-\n late to her removal. We regard those statements as suffi-\n cient to constitute an express waiver of any discrimination\n claims relating to her removal action and thus sufficient to\n give this court jurisdiction over her petition for review. See\n Harris v. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n, 972 F.3d 1307, 1317\u201318\n (Fed. Cir. 2020); Diggs v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 670\n F.3d 1353, 1355 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Davidson v. U.S.\n Postal Serv., 24 F.3d 223, 224 (Fed. Cir. 1994).\n                              III\n     On the merits, Ms. Miller has abandoned her claims of\n discrimination and retaliation. Instead, she argues that\n the removal decision was not supported by substantial ev-\n idence and that the administrative judge\u2019s decision was in-\n fected by improper procedure.\n     1. There is no merit to the argument that the removal\n decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. The re-\n moval action was based on a single ground: Ms. Miller\u2019s\n failure to renew her LPN license. There is no dispute that\n maintaining LPN licensure is a condition of her employ-\n ment and that it was her personal responsibility to ensure\n that her license was renewed and not allowed to lapse.\n There is also no dispute that Ms. Miller failed to renew her\n LPN license prior to its expiration and her removal.\n\fCase: 20-1820     Document: 25     Page: 6    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                                MILLER   v. DVA\n\n\n\n      2. Nor is there any force to Ms. Miller\u2019s argument that\n the agency somehow interfered with her ability to renew\n her license. The administrative judge found that Ms. Mil-\n ler\u2019s access to agency computers and other resources was\n uninhibited and that, in any event, she could have used\n outside resources to complete the tasks necessary to effect\n the renewal.\n     3. Ms. Miller\u2019s procedural arguments are equally de-\n void of merit. Her principal focus is on the rebuttal evi-\n dence that the DVA presented to the administrative judge\n during the Board proceedings. Her first objection is that\n the agency\u2019s rebuttal evidence was not before the deci-\n sionmaker at the time the agency made the decision to re-\n move her. For that reason, she argues, the evidence should\n not have been presented to the administrative judge in her\n appeal to the Board.\n     There is no legal requirement that all the evidence an\n agency presents in a Board appeal must have been pre-\n sented to the agency at the time of the agency action that\n is under review. While the Board generally may not uphold\n an adverse agency action on a ground different from the\n charge levied by the agency as the basis for the action, see\n King v. Nazelrod, 43 F.3d 663, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the ev-\n idence that can be presented to the Board in support of that\n charge is not limited to the evidence recited in the agency\u2019s\n notices of proposed and final action, see Licausi v. Office of\n Pers. Mgmt., 350 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Among\n other reasons for introducing additional evidence in Board\n proceedings, it is frequently the case\u2014as it was here\u2014that\n parties raise new issues to the Board, such as affirmative\n defenses, and that those new issues give rise to newly rel-\n evant evidence. 2\n\n\n\n     2  Ms. Miller contends that \u201cthe Board is limited to\n reviewing the grounds invoked by the agency and may not\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25    Page: 7    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n MILLER   v. DVA                                            7\n\n\n\n      The agency\u2019s case-in-chief was straightforward. It\n consisted of proof that Ms. Miller failed to comply with a\n condition of her employment: LPN licensure. As the ad-\n ministrative judge noted, the agency\u2019s rebuttal evidence\n was directed to Ms. Miller\u2019s affirmative defenses and her\n reasons why she should not be faulted for allowing her LPN\n license to lapse.\n     Because the agency\u2019s rebuttal statement consisted of\n evidence responding to Ms. Miller\u2019s affirmative defenses\n and her replies to the charge, the agency\u2019s rebuttal state-\n ment was appropriate rebuttal evidence. Ms. Miller\u2019s rep-\n resentative objected to the introduction of the agency\u2019s\n rebuttal evidence, even though it was provided for in the\n administrative judge\u2019s order canceling the hearing in the\n case. Her representative did not, however, seek leave to\n offer a substantive response to the agency\u2019s rebuttal state-\n ment. We conclude that the procedure employed by the ad-\n ministrative judge with respect to the agency\u2019s rebuttal\n statement was not improper and did not deprive Ms. Miller\n of her rights to due process of law.\n\n\n\n\n \u2018substitute what it considers to be better basis and evidence\n (undisput[ed] new rebuttal evidence in this case) for re-\n moval than what was identified by the agency and Notice.\u2019\u201d\n Reply Br. 8 (quoting O\u2019Keefe v. U.S. Postal Serv., 318 F.3d\n 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). That contention is based on a\n misquotation of O\u2019Keefe. The words \u201cand evidence\u201d and the\n ensuing parenthetical do not appear in the quoted passage\n from O\u2019Keefe. Hence, that case does not stand for the prop-\n osition that an agency\u2019s presentation of evidence in Board\n proceedings is limited to evidence previously set forth in a\n notice of proposed removal. Instead, O\u2019Keefe stands for the\n quite different proposition that the Board may not affirm a\n removal action on the basis of charges not set out in the\n notice of proposed removal.\n\fCase: 20-1820    Document: 25      Page: 8    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n8                                               MILLER   v. DVA\n\n\n\n      4. Finally, Ms. Miller complains that the agency ad-\n vised her that it would detail her to a non-patient-care po-\n sition pending the removal proceedings when she returned\n to duty, but that no such detail was ever arranged. Ms.\n Miller, however, did not return to work after the issuance\n of the notice of proposed removal. Accordingly, by its\n terms, the proposal to assign her to a detail never came into\n effect. Because Ms. Miller did not take the step that would\n have triggered her assignment to a detail during the re-\n moval proceedings, the agency did not act improperly by\n not assigning her to a detail for that limited period.\n      In sum, Ms. Miller has not overcome the single dispos-\n itive fact in this case: She was required to maintain her\n LPN license as a condition of her employment, and she\n failed to do so. Because substantial evidence supports the\n administrative judge\u2019s ruling on that factual issue and be-\n cause Ms. Miller has failed to point to any other infirmities\n in the proceedings before the agency or the Board, we sus-\n tain the Board\u2019s ruling upholding her removal.\n                        AFFIRMED\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/616443/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/669852/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/784346/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/780795/"], "case_name": "Miller v.

SKYLINE USA, INC.\n\n\n\n    DYK, Circuit Judge.\n     Plaintiff Super-Sparkly Safety Stuff, LLC (\u201cSuper-\n Sparkly\u201d) appeals a decision of the United States District\n Court for the Northern District of Texas. The district court\n entered summary judgment in favor of Defendant Skyline\n USA, Inc. (\u201cSkyline\u201d), concluding that Skyline had not in-\n fringed Super-Sparkly\u2019s design patent. We affirm.\n                          BACKGROUND\n     Super-Sparkly owns a design patent for bedazzled pep-\n per spray canisters, U.S. Patent No. D731,172 (\u201cthe \u2019172\n patent\u201d). This patent claims a design for a pepper spray\n canister decorated with rhinestones, in which rhinestones\n cover the bottom and some portion of the vertical part of a\n pepper spray canister.\n     Skyline sells a line of \u201cBling It On\u201d pepper spray canis-\n ters that are decorated with rhinestones. Unlike the de-\n signs claimed in the \u2019172 patent, the bottom surface of\n Skyline\u2019s canisters is not decorated with rhinestones.\n     In February 2017, Super-Sparkly sent Skyline a cease-\n and-desist letter in which it accused Skyline\u2019s pepper spray\n canisters of infringing its design patent. Skyline re-\n sponded in April 2017, explaining that the accused product\n did not infringe Super-Sparkly\u2019s design patent because the\n bottom of the canister was not decorated with rhinestones.\n      Super-Sparkly filed suit against Skyline in the United\n States District Court for the Northern District of Texas on\n March 13, 2018, alleging direct and induced infringement\n of the \u2019172 patent. 1 Super-Sparkly subsequently contacted\n\n\n       1 Super-Sparkly also owns U.S. Patent No. D696,857\n (\u201cthe \u2019857 patent\u201d), which is similar to the \u2019172 patent.\n While Super-Sparkly\u2019s complaint referred in passing to the\n \u2019857 patent, the substance of the complaint involves only\n the \u2019172 patent, and the district court found that Super-\n\fCase: 20-1490    Document: 47      Page: 3    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v. SKYLINE USA, INC.          3\n\n\n\n Amazon.com, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation, which\n resold the accused product, alleging that Skyline\u2019s product\n infringed Super-Sparkly\u2019s design patents. As a result, Am-\n azon and Dollar General stopped purchasing the accused\n product from Skyline. Thereafter, in the infringement suit,\n Skyline asserted counterclaims against Super-Sparkly, al-\n leging unfair competition under the Lanham Act, common\n law unfair competition, tortious interference with contrac-\n tual relations, tortious interference with business rela-\n tions, tortious interference with prospective contracts, and\n business disparagement.\n      On August 6, 2019, Skyline filed a motion for partial\n summary judgment of noninfringement. On August 21,\n 2019, Super-Sparkly filed a motion for an extension of time\n to respond to the motion for partial summary judgment on\n the grounds that discovery was not yet complete. Then, on\n August 27, 2019, instead of opposing Skyline\u2019s motion for\n partial summary judgment on the merits, Super-Sparkly\n filed a response pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\n dure 56(d), claiming a lack of sufficient facts to file a re-\n sponse. The district court denied Super-Sparkly\u2019s motion\n for an extension of time and granted summary judgment of\n noninfringement. The district court also certified its entry\n of partial summary judgment as final under Federal Rule\n of Civil Procedure 54(b). Super-Sparkly appeals.\n                           DISCUSSION\n     This appeal requires us to resolve two issues: first,\n whether summary judgment was properly certified as fi-\n nal, thereby conferring jurisdiction on the court; and sec-\n ond, whether summary judgment of noninfringement was\n warranted.\n\n\n\n Sparkly alleged infringement of only the \u2019172 patent. On\n appeal, despite again making passing reference to the \u2019857\n patent, Super-Sparkly does not dispute this determination.\n\fCase: 20-1490     Document: 47        Page: 4   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4            SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF     v. SKYLINE USA, INC.\n\n\n\n                                  I\n      When a district court certifies a decision as final under\n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), we must review the\n finality of the judgment de novo to ensure we have jurisdic-\n tion, even if the parties agree that jurisdiction is proper.\n Ultra-Precision Mfg. v. Ford Motor Co., 338 F.3d 1353,\n 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing W.L. Gore & Assocs. v. Int\u2019l\n Med. Prosthetics Rsch. Assocs., Inc., 975 F.2d 858, 862 (Fed.\n Cir. 1992)). For Rule 54(b) to apply, three prerequisites\n must be met: \u201c(1) multiple claims for relief or multiple par-\n ties must be involved; (2) at least one claim or the rights\n and liabilities of at least one party must be finally decided;\n and (3) the district court must find that there is no just rea-\n son for delaying an appeal.\u201d Alfred E. Mann Found. for Sci.\n Rsch. v. Cochlear Corp., 841 F.3d 1334, 1347 (Fed. Cir.\n 2016) (citing 10 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Prac-\n tice and Procedure \u00a7 2656 (3d ed. 2016)). While we review\n finality de novo, we review the district court\u2019s determina-\n tion that there is no just reason for delay for abuse of dis-\n cretion. W.L. Gore, 975 F.2d at 862.\n      Here, all three prerequisites are met. First, the case\n involves multiple claims, as Skyline\u2019s counterclaims are\n still pending before the district court. Second, Super-\n Sparkly\u2019s two patent infringement claims were finally de-\n cided by the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment of\n noninfringement. Third, the district court did not abuse its\n discretion in determining that there is no just reason for\n delay.\n     As the three prerequisites to Rule 54(b) are met, we\n find that the case was properly certified and that we have\n jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\n                                 II\n     Super-Sparkly argues that summary judgment was im-\n proper (1) on the merits because there was a genuine issue\n of material fact as to infringement, and (2) under Federal\n\fCase: 20-1490     Document: 47       Page: 5   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v. SKYLINE USA, INC.           5\n\n\n\n Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), in light of Super-Sparkly\u2019s\n asserted need for additional discovery to respond to the\n summary judgment motion.\n                                 A\n      Design patent infringement occurs when a party,\n \u201cwithout license of the owner, (1) applies the patented de-\n sign, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of\n manufacture for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes\n for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or\n colorable imitation has been applied.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 289. The\n \u201cordinary observer\u201d test is used to determine whether a de-\n sign patent has been infringed. Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v.\n Swisa, Inc., 543 F.3d 665, 678 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc).\n The test inquires whether an accused design appears \u201csub-\n stantially the same\u201d as a patented design, such that \u201can\n ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser\n usually gives,\u201d would be induced \u201cto purchase one suppos-\n ing it to be the other.\u201d Id. at 670 (quoting Gorham Co. v.\n White, 81 U.S. 511, 528 (1871)).\n     We review summary judgment of noninfringement de\n novo. Accent Packaging, Inc. v. Leggett & Platt, Inc., 707\n F.3d 1318, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Laryngeal Mask Co.\n v. Ambu A/S, 618 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2010)).\n     Super-Sparkly and Skyline agree that the difference\n between the \u2019172 patent and the accused design is that the\n former includes rhinestones on the bottom of the pepper\n spray canister, whereas the latter does not. The district\n court did not err in concluding that that this difference pre-\n cludes a finding of infringement under the ordinary ob-\n server test.\n     Under the ordinary observer test, the claimed and ac-\n cused designs may be \u201csufficiently distinct\u201d and \u201cplainly\n dissimilar,\u201d such that an ordinary observer clearly would\n not find the two designs \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1490      Document: 47     Page: 6   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6             SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v. SKYLINE USA, INC.\n\n\n\n Egyptian Goddess, 543 F.3d at 678. When the designs are\n not \u201cplainly dissimilar,\u201d the analysis\n       will benefit from a comparison of the claimed and\n       accused designs with the prior art . . . . Where\n       there are many examples of similar prior art de-\n       signs . . . differences between the claimed and ac-\n       cused designs that might not be noticeable in the\n       abstract can become significant to the hypothetical\n       ordinary observer who is conversant with the prior\n       art.\n Id.\n     The \u2019172 patent claims a very simple design, in which\n rhinestones are applied to two surfaces of a canister: the\n vertical cylinder and the bottom. Removing the rhine-\n stones from one of these surfaces\u2014the bottom\u2014is a signif-\n icant departure from the claimed design. The \u2019172 patent\n and the accused design are thus plainly dissimilar; because\n the accused design lacks rhinestones on one of the two sur-\n faces decorated in the claimed design, an ordinary observer\n would not find the two designs substantially the same.\n      Even assuming that the two designs are not \u201cplainly\n dissimilar,\u201d a comparison with the prior art makes clear\n that the accused design does not infringe the \u2019172 patent.\n Although there do not appear to be \u201cmany examples of sim-\n ilar prior art designs,\u201d the prior art \u201cPepperface\u201d reference,\n dating from 2006, was widely marketed and endorsed by\n various celebrities. 2 Its design has rhinestones around the\n majority of the canister, but not on the top (near the spray\n nozzle) or bottom of the cylinder. Per Egyptian Goddess,\n then, the Pepperface design highlights that the key differ-\n ence between the \u2019172 patent and the accused design is that\n the bottom of the cylinder is decorated with rhinestones.\n\n\n       2A screenshot of the archived Pepperface website is\n included as an attachment to this opinion.\n\fCase: 20-1490     Document: 47       Page: 7   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF    v. SKYLINE USA, INC.           7\n\n\n\n As such, the attention of a hypothetical ordinary observer\n conversant with bedazzled pepper spray canisters would be\n drawn to the presence or absence of rhinestones on the bot-\n tom of the cylinder. See Egyptian Goddess, 543 F.3d at 676.\n     The hypothetical ordinary observer would therefore\n find significant the lack of rhinestones on the bottom of the\n accused design and would not confuse the accused design\n with the \u2019172 patent. The district court correctly concluded\n that the ordinary observer test necessitates a finding of\n noninfringement.\n                                 B\n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) provides that\n where, on a motion for summary judgment, \u201ca nonmovant\n shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons,\n it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition,\u201d\n the district court may defer consideration of the motion or\n deny it; allow time to pursue affidavits, declarations, or dis-\n covery; or \u201cissue any other appropriate order.\u201d Fed. R. Civ.\n P. 56(d).\n     We apply the law of the regional circuit in interpreting\n and applying Rule 56(d). Accent Packaging, 707 F.3d at\n 1325. \u201cThe Fifth Circuit,\u201d where this case arose, \u201creviews\n the district court\u2019s dispositions of Rule 56(d) motions for an\n abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. (citing Raby v. Livingston, 600\n F.3d 552, 561 (5th Cir. 2010)). In the Fifth Circuit, Rule\n 56(d) motions \u201care \u2018broadly favored and should be liberally\n granted\u2019 because the rule is designed to \u2018safeguard non-\n moving parties from summary judgment motions that they\n cannot adequately oppose.\u2019\u201d Raby, 600 F.3d at 561 (quoting\n Culwell v. City of Fort Worth, 468 F.3d 868, 871 (5th Cir.\n 1999)). However, a request under Rule 56(d) must explain\n how \u201cspecified facts . . . if adduced, will influence the out-\n come of the pending summary judgment motion.\u201d Id. (quot-\n ing C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt. Inc., 137 F.3d 41,\n 44 (1st Cir. 1998)). \u201cIf it appears that further discovery will\n not provide evidence creating a genuine issue of material\n\fCase: 20-1490    Document: 47      Page: 8    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n8            SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v.

Corp., 197\n F.3d 694, 720 (5th Cir. 1999)).\n      In his supporting declaration, counsel for Super-\n Sparkly listed fifteen facts without which Super-Sparkly\n was purportedly unable to file a response to Skyline\u2019s mo-\n tion. Super-Sparkly sought information relating to Sky-\n line\u2019s knowledge and opinion of the \u2019172 patent and the\n accused design; the creation and sale of the accused prod-\n uct; and Skyline\u2019s discovery conduct. None of this infor-\n mation, however, has any bearing on the ordinary observer\n test for design patent infringement. Because the infor-\n mation for which Super-Sparkly sought further discovery\n was irrelevant to the issue of infringement, Super-Sparkly\n failed to explain how the specified facts could influence the\n outcome of the motion. The district court did not abuse its\n discretion by denying Super-Sparkly\u2019s request under\n Rule 56(d) and entering summary judgment of nonin-\n fringement.\n                        AFFIRMED\n\fCase: 20-1490   Document: 47       Page: 9    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v.

Thomas filed a petition for a writ of manda-\n mus with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veter-\n ans Court). Arguing that the Department of Veterans\n Affairs (VA) was being dilatory in deciding various claims\n for benefits he had filed, Mr. Thomas asked for an order\n directing the relevant VA authorities to issue decisions on\n the matters that were before them. The Veterans Court\n denied the petition, concluding that, at least by the time of\n the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, each matter at issue had in\n fact been decided by the VA authority before which it had\n been pending\u2014thus mooting the mandamus request for re-\n lief. See Thomas v. Wilkie, No. 19-2017, 2019 WL 6121120\n (Vet. App. Nov. 19, 2019). Mr. Thomas appeals. Because\n Mr. Thomas has raised no question that is within our lim-\n ited jurisdiction, we dismiss his appeal.\n                               I\n     Mr. Thomas served two tours of active duty with the\n United States Marine Corps\u2014from April 1979 to April\n 1982 and from June 1982 to June 1984. Starting in 2001,\n he filed various claims for benefits with VA, which granted\n some of the requested benefits.\n     On June 28, 2001, Mr. Thomas filed a claim for benefits\n related to bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. On\n September 26, 2005, and again on June 9, 2007, the rele-\n vant VA regional office denied the claim, and Mr. Thomas\n appealed to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. While the ap-\n peal was pending, the regional office on July 3, 2008,\n granted Mr. Thomas benefits for bilateral hearing loss\n (20% disabled) and for tinnitus (10% disabled), with an ef-\n fective date of November 19, 2004, but it did not change its\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30     Page: 3    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n THOMAS V. WILKIE                                          3\n\n\n\n ruling about vertigo. On May 26, 2010, the Board denied\n the appeal still before it.\n      Well before that denial, Mr. Thomas filed, on July 18,\n 2008, a separate claim for benefits related to, among oth-\n ers, depression and Meniere\u2019s disease, a disorder of the in-\n ner ear similar to vertigo affecting balance and hearing.\n Ultimately, on March 17, 2014, the Board granted Mr.\n Thomas\u2019s claim for benefits relating to Meniere\u2019s disease\n and vertigo, to which the regional office, on May 10, 2014,\n assigned a 30% disability rating, with an effective date of\n November 19, 2004, the same as for the benefits based on\n bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. In 2017, the regional\n office granted Mr. Thomas an earlier effective date\u2014June\n 28, 2001, the date of his original informal claim\u2014for each\n of his claims, based on bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus,\n Meniere\u2019s disease, and vertigo.\n      On January 18, 2018, the Board remanded Mr.\n Thomas\u2019s claim based on Meniere\u2019s disease to the regional\n office for that office to determine whether Mr. Thomas was\n entitled to a higher disability rating (than the 30% rating\n already awarded) under a diagnostic code that considered\n Meniere\u2019s disease coupled with cerebellar gait (a stagger-\n ing, uncoordinated or wide-based gait indicative of cerebral\n lesions). The Board explained that it \u201cregret[ted] the addi-\n tional delay\u201d occasioned by the need for additional exami-\n nation of any symptoms of cerebellar gait, and it requested\n expedited handling of Mr. Thomas\u2019s case under 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 20.900(c) (2003).\n     Mr. Thomas received a supplemental examination two\n months later, on March 20, 2018 (the March 2018 exam).\n The regional office issued a supplemental rating decision\n on September 12, 2018, finding that Mr. Thomas was enti-\n tled to an increased 100% rating for Meniere\u2019s disease un-\n der the new diagnostic code, with an effective date of the\n March 2018 exam, when it was documented that his condi-\n tions met the requirements of the diagnostic code. Mr.\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30     Page: 4    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                           THOMAS V. WILKIE\n\n\n\n Thomas returned to the Board, contending that he was en-\n titled to an earlier effective date for his 100% rating, but\n the Board rejected that contention on November 2, 2018.\n Mr. Thomas\u2019s appeal of that Board decision resulted in a\n joint motion for partial remand. Thomas, 2019 WL\n 6121120, at *1 n.1.\n     On February 26, 2019, the original regional office found\n clear and unmistakable error in having separately consid-\n ered bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, on one hand, and\n Meniere\u2019s disease, on the other. It therefore discontinued\n the separate consideration, leaving Mr. Thomas with a\n 100% disability rating effective March 18, 2018. The Sec-\n retary has asserted that Mr. Thomas did not appeal that\n decision to the Board, and Mr. Thomas appears to dispute\n that assertion.\n     Mr. Thomas did not seek only disability benefits. He\n separately filed a claim for benefits for special home adap-\n tation and specially adapted housing in August 2018. The\n regional office denied the claim on October 31, 2018. Mr.\n Thomas filed a Notice of Disagreement on November 15,\n 2018. On January 15, 2019, VA assigned Mr. Thomas\u2019s No-\n tice of Disagreement to a new regional office to issue a\n Statement of the Case, which is the next step in the process\n for appealing to the Board.\n     On March 21, 2019, just two months after the transfer\n of his case, Mr. Thomas filed with the Veterans Court the\n mandamus petition that gave rise to the present appeal. 1\n\n\n\n    1     Mr. Thomas filed at least three other, nearly iden-\n tical petitions for writs of mandamus within a one-year pe-\n riod. See Thomas v. Wilkie, No. 20-4445, 2020 WL 4355638\n (Vet. App. July 30, 2020); Thomas v. Wilkie, No. 19-6414,\n 2019 WL 6461825 (Vet.

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n Crediting the Secretary\u2019s representations, the Veterans\n Court explained that it was \u201csatisfied that [Mr. Thomas\u2019s]\n claims are being adjudicated at the Agency level, the relief\n sought has been granted and his petition . . . is moot\u201d and\n dismissed Mr. Thomas\u2019s petition on November 19, 2019.\n Id.\n     Mr. Thomas timely appealed.\n                               II\n     Our jurisdiction in appeals from the Veterans Court\n under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292 is limited. One limit is the consti-\n tutional rule that we may not decide a case that does not\n involve a live dispute. North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244,\n 246 (1971) (\u201cMootness is a jurisdictional question because\n the Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or ab-\n stract propositions.\u201d (citations and internal quotation\n marks omitted)). Other limits are statutory. See Wanless\n v. Shinseki, 618 F.3d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Except\n where a constitutional claim is raised, we \u201cmay not review\n (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a chal-\n lenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a par-\n ticular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). This court does have\n jurisdiction to \u201cdecide all relevant questions of law, includ-\n ing interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions.\u201d\n Id. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). Those limits apply to an appeal under\n \u00a7 7292 of a Veterans Court decision on a petition for a writ\n of mandamus; in particular, we may not review a Veterans\n Court decision whether to grant a mandamus petition as-\n serting a statutory claim unless a \u201cnon-frivolous legal\n\fCase: 20-1324     Document: 30      Page: 6    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                             THOMAS V.

Cir. 2020) (applying both\n mootness and legal-question principles to dismiss appeal).\n     In this case, Mr. Thomas\u2019s petition for a writ of manda-\n mus, fairly construed, was a request that the VA act on his\n claims in a timely fashion. The Veterans Court concluded\n that there was no live dispute before it because Mr.\n Thomas\u2019s mandamus petition sought relief in the form of a\n directive to the VA to act on his claims and \u201cthe relief\n sought has been granted.\u201d Thomas, 2019 WL 6121120, at\n *1. That ruling, made in the mandamus context, invokes\n the general principle that an appeal should \u201cbe dismissed\n as moot when . . . a court of appeals cannot grant \u2018any ef-\n fectual relief whatever\u2019 in favor of the appellant.\u201d Calderon\n v. Moore, 518 U.S. 149, 150 (1996) (per curiam) (quoting\n Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895)); see also, e.g., Mote\n v. Wilkie, 976 F.3d 1337, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Ebanks v.\n Shulkin, 877 F.3d 1037, 1039\u201340 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Monk v.\n Shulkin, 855 F.3d 1312, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n     We need not and do not decide whether the characteri-\n zation of the dispute as \u201cmoot\u201d is correct. According to the\n Veterans Court\u2019s description, this case does not involve the\n usual pattern of mootness\u2014in which a case that was live\n when filed is no longer a live one because of a post-filing\n change in relevant circumstances. Here, what the Veter-\n ans Court determined Mr. Thomas was seeking but already\n had received (i.e., VA action on his claims) was something\n he already had received even before the mandamus peti-\n tion was filed. 2 Moreover, although the mandamus\n\n\n     2   This is not a case of VA action taken after the filing\n of a mandamus petition to moot an issue of unreasonable\n delay raised in that petition. See Monk, 855 F.3d at 1321\n (discussing that situation). Nor is there a showing here of\n the applicability of mootness exceptions for \u201cvoluntary\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30     Page: 7    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n THOMAS V. WILKIE                                          7\n\n\n\n petition is hardly clear, it is possible that the mandamus\n petition was effectively seeking even faster VA action than\n he already had received or would receive without judicial\n intervention. For those reasons, whether dismissal for\n \u201cmootness\u201d was correct raises some questions.\n     But we need not address those questions\u2014or the re-\n lated question whether the dispute is a live one in this\n court. Mr. Thomas has identified no concrete difference be-\n tween a dismissal and a denial of the mandamus petition\n in this case; he would be in exactly the same position re-\n gardless. And under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, we lack statutory\n jurisdiction over his challenge to the Veterans Court ruling\n viewed as a denial, because he has raised no \u201cnon-frivolous\n legal question\u201d about that ruling so viewed. Beasley, 709\n F.3d at 1158.\n     In his mandamus petition, Mr. Thomas presented a\n statutory challenge, seeking to compel the VA to take ac-\n tion that had been withheld for an unreasonably long time.\n But he has presented no non-frivolous argument that the\n Veterans Court committed a legal error regarding such un-\n reasonable delay under the standards of Telecommunica-\n tions Research & Action Center v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 76\n (D.C. Cir. 1984) (TRAC), adopted by this court in Martin v.\n O\u2019Rourke, 891 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2018), for unreasonable-\n delay challenges. More precisely and narrowly, to secure\n the \u201cextraordinary\u201d relief of mandamus, Mr. Thomas had\n to show, at a minimum, that he had \u201ca clear legal right to\n relief\u201d under the TRAC standards. Beasley, 709 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n cessation of challenged conduct,\u201d Adarand Constructors,\n Inc. v. Slater, 528 U.S. 216, 222 (2000) (per curiam), or\n challenged conduct that is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evad-\n ing review,\u201d Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, 136\n S.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n 1157. Mr. Thomas has no non-frivolous basis for asserting\n a legal error under that even more demanding standard.\n     Mr. Thomas cannot point to any ruling by the Veterans\n Court in this matter that contains a legal error regarding\n the unreasonable-delay issue. The Veterans Court did not\n address the merits of that issue. Nor has Mr. Thomas\n pointed to any basis on which we could find that a correct\n view of the law\u2014under TRAC as applied in the mandamus\n setting\u2014could have supported mandamus relief in this\n case. As to the disability claims based on Meniere\u2019s dis-\n ease, vertigo, tinnitus, and bilateral hearing loss, Mr.\n Thomas received a decision from the regional office on Feb-\n ruary 26, 2019, and by March 21, 2019, when he filed his\n mandamus petition, there could have been no argument for\n unreasonable withholding of some further VA action. 3 As\n to Mr. Thomas\u2019s claims regarding specially adapted hous-\n ing, Mr. Thomas filed his mandamus petition just four\n months after filing his Notice of Disagreement with the Oc-\n tober 2018 denial, and the VA was in the midst of prepar-\n ing the Statement of the Case that is the essential next step\n in proceeding to the Board for review of the denial. There\n is no non-frivolous basis for an argument of a clear legal\n right to faster processing. In these circumstances, we see\n no non-frivolous legal question regarding unreasonable de-\n lay that would give us jurisdiction under \u00a7 7292 to review\n the mandamus decision of the Veterans Court.\n     In this court, Mr. Thomas devotes much of his appeal\n to the merits of his claims, specifically seeking an earlier\n effective date for benefits, citing evidence that he alleges\n the Board ignored. Thomas Op. Br. 10\u201312. But none of\n those arguments identifies a legal issue that was presented\n to the Veterans Court, let alone resolved by that court.\n\n\n     3  The parties appear to dispute whether Mr. Thomas\n missed his opportunity for further review of that decision.\n We need not resolve that dispute.\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30      Page: 9   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n THOMAS V. WILKIE                                          9\n\n\n\n Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to decide factual issues or\n the application of legal standards to the particular facts,\n unless there is a constitutional claim.          38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Here, there is no constitutional claim. Alt-\n hough Mr. Thomas states that he was denied due process,\n he provides no basis for that assertion apart from his mer-\n its challenges to the VA\u2019s particular determinations on his\n claims, so his due-process challenge is constitutional in\n name only and is not reviewable.

See Nken\n v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).\n     Based on the papers submitted, we conclude that the\n appellants have not established that a stay of the final\n judgment pending appeal is warranted here. 1\n\n\n     1   The dissent and the government believe that CIT\n Rules 62(d) and (e), read together, require an automatic\n stay because the judgment here functions as a monetary\n judgment. We disagree. The CIT considered and rejected\n the argument that the two rules trigger an automatic stay\n pending appeal when the government is the appellant; the\n government remains unable to cite precedent to the con-\n trary, at least as to the CIT\u2019s rules specifically. See Appel-\n lees\u2019 Resp. at 8. To be sure, the dissent cites non-binding\n precedent interpreting the materially similar Federal\n Rules of Civil Procedure in this way.

The United\n States appealed.\n      On August 13, 2020, the United States filed with the\n Trade Court, under U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT)\n Rule 62, a motion to stay the judgment\u2014whose only non-\n declaratory portion is an order to refund an amount that\n plaintiffs do not dispute is a matter of easy, objective cal-\n culation. About a month later, the Trade Court denied the\n motion. Stay Opinion, 2020 WL 5530091, at *3. The court\n first rejected the government\u2019s contention that, because the\n refund order is purely monetary in character and easily cal-\n culable in amount, the government is entitled to an auto-\n matic stay pending appeal without posting a bond or other\n security. Id. The Trade Court also rejected the govern-\n ment\u2019s argument for a stay under the four-part standard\n that considers the merits, the potential for irreparable in-\n jury to the stay applicant, the other parties\u2019 interests, and\n the public interest\u2014though the Trade Court enjoined liq-\n uidation of the subject steel entries pending appeal. Id. at\n *2\u20134 (applying standard from Hilton v. Braunskill, 481\n U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).\n    The United States now seeks a stay from this court.

That proposition, ar-\n rived at in two steps, is supported by ample precedent ap-\n plying language, notably from Federal Rule of Civil\n Procedure 62, materially the same as the language of CIT\n Rule 62. I would apply this proposition in exercising our\n stay authority under Federal Circuit Rule 8.\n     The first step is the automatic-stay principle that ap-\n plies to appellants generally. CIT Rule 62(d) states: \u201cWhen\n an appeal is taken, the appellant, by giving a supersedeas\n bond, may obtain a stay subject to the exception contained\n in subdivision (a) of this rule.\u201d 1 The only condition is the\n giving of a supersedeas bond, which must be \u201capproved by\n the court.\u201d CIT Rule 62(d) (\u201cThe stay is effective when the\n supersedeas bond is approved by the court.\u201d). These provi-\n sions mirror Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(d) as it stood before 2018, in\n which year its language was moved, with slight modifica-\n tions, to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(b). 2\n\n\n     1   The referred-to \u201cexception\u201d is the exception for \u201cin-\n junction[s]\u201d stated in CIT Rule 62(a): \u201cUnless otherwise or-\n dered by the court, an interlocutory or final judgment in an\n action for an injunction shall not be stayed during the pe-\n riod after its entry and until an appeal is taken or during\n the pendency of any appeal.\u201d\n     2    Fed.

Congress has provided: \u201cSecurity for damages or\n costs shall not be required of the United States, any depart-\n ment or agency thereof or any party acting under the direc-\n tion of any such department or agency on the issuance of\n process or the institution or prosecution of any proceeding.\u201d\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2408. That principle is reflected in CIT Rule\n 62(e), which immediately follows the automatic-stay provi-\n sion of Rule 62(d). CIT Rule 62(e) states: \u201cWhen an appeal\n\fCase: 20-2157    Document: 32      Page: 10    Filed: 12/10/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                              TRANSPACIFIC STEEL LLC   v. US\n\n\n\n is taken by the United States or an officer or agency thereof\n or by direction of any department of the Government of the\n United States and the operation or enforcement of the judg-\n ment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall\n be required from the appellant.\u201d That language matches\n the language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(e) as it stood in 2006.\n The current language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(e)\u2014adopted in\n 2007 as part of the Rules-wide language changes that, ac-\n cording to the 2007 Advisory Committee Notes, were \u201cin-\n tended to be stylistic only\u201d\u2014reads: \u201cThe court must not\n require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appel-\n lant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United\n States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed\n by a department of the federal government.\u201d\n     The no-required-security language of CIT Rule 62(e),\n and of its pre-2007 Federal Rules counterpart, is readily\n understood, as a textual matter, to bear a simple relation-\n ship to the automatic-stay language of the preceding sub-\n section on automatic stays.         The bond required of\n appellants generally, as the sole condition of obtaining the\n stay as of right, must not be required of the federal govern-\n ment to obtain that automatic stay\u2014which is available to\n the federal government as of right for monetary judgments\n without a bond. That straightforward relationship be-\n tween Rule 62(d) and 62(e) reflects the recognized lack of\n need for security against the government. Rule 62(e) can-\n not sensibly be read as depriving the federal government,\n alone among all appellants facing monetary judgments, of\n the entitlement to an automatic stay of a monetary judg-\n ment without further inquiry into the merits and equities\n unless it posts security that the Rule and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804\n forbid the court to require. This understanding of the lan-\n guage of CIT Rule 62(e), and of the identical pre-2007 Fed.\n R. Civ. P. 62(e), is reinforced by the current language of\n Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(e), which is even clearer in its implica-\n tion. The new language was included among the revisions\n that the Rules revisers said made no substantive change of\n\fCase: 20-2157    Document: 32     Page: 11   Filed: 12/10/2020\n\n\n\n\n TRANSPACIFIC STEEL LLC   v.

That conclu-\n sion appears to have been reached, in various contexts, by\n the several circuit courts that have addressed the matter. 3\n And the same conclusion has been reached by numerous\n district courts. 4 See Wright & Miller \u00a7 2905.

US\n\n\n\n a stay pending appeal without bond anyway, though sub-\n ject to certain conditions, under the usual four-part stay\n analysis. Id. at 167\u201368. 5\n     I think that the above considerations suffice to support\n the conclusion that, in a Trade Court case, if the relevant\n part of the judgment at issue is monetary, the United\n States is entitled to a stay pending appeal without posting\n a supersedeas bond or other security and without consider-\n ation of the merits or equities. That conclusion is well-\n grounded in the text of CIT Rule 62, for the reasons indi-\n cated. It is also supported in a substantial, highly lopsided\n body of judicial decisions going back many years under the\n Federal Rules counterpart to the CIT Rule. Plaintiffs\n themselves have not contested this legal proposition.\n                              B\n      Plaintiffs dispute only the application of the proposi-\n tion to this case. In doing so, they do not dispute that the\n amount ordered to be paid\u2014the difference between the tar-\n iffs they paid and a 25% tariff (plus costs and interest)\u2014is\n easily and objectively calculated. Their argument, instead,\n is simply that the portion of the judgment ordering the\n United States to refund plaintiffs that difference (plus\n costs and interests) is not a monetary judgment subject to\n the automatic-stay principle. I disagree. When a judgment\n contains a provision requiring payment of money, in an\n\n\n\n      5  The Bankruptcy Court relied on two district court\n decisions, neither of which ruled on the merits of a govern-\n ment request for an automatic stay of a monetary judgment\n without posting a bond.

Life & Annuity Ins. Co.\n v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 216 (2002); see also Bowen v.\n Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 915\u201316 (1988) (Scalia, J., dis-\n senting) (\u201c[T]he line between damages and specific relief\n must surely be drawn on the basis of the substance of the\n claim, and not its mere form.\u201d). Our court and other circuit\n courts have similarly focused on a judgment\u2019s substance ra-\n ther than its form when determining whether the judg-\n ment is monetary. See, e.g., ActiveVideo Networks, 2012\n WL 10716768, at *1 (\u201cThe form of the order to pay money\n does not matter; what matters is \u2018whether the judgment\n involved is monetary or nonmonetary.\u2019\u201d (quoting Hebert,\n 953 F.2d at 938)); see also Titan Tire Corp. of Bryan v.\n United Steel Workers of America, Local 890L, No. 09-4460,\n 2010 WL 815557, at *1 (6th Cir.

Here, the\n district court\u2019s judgment binds Titan to pay a specific sum\n of money, i.e., back wages.\u201d). The refund order here in sub-\n stance compels the United States to transfer money after\n performing a straightforward calculation to determine the\n amount. 6\n\n\n\n     6   Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint reinforces the un-\n derstanding of the judgment as monetary in the relevant\n sense.

Plaintiffs\u2019 Opp. to Stay Motion at 8.\n But even aside from the fact that those decisions are not\n binding precedent for us, neither decision justifies a con-\n clusion that the refund order here is outside the automatic-\n stay principle.\n     Plaintiffs first rely on Badger-Powhatan, A Division of\n Figgie International, Inc. v. United States, in which the\n Trade Court\u2019s judgment on the merits of the case ordered a\n \u201cremand[] to the Department of Commerce International\n Trade Administration for issuance of an amended final de-\n termination\u201d with the \u201cestimated antidumping duties\n be[ing] as closely tailored to actual antidumping duties as\n is reasonable given data available to [the Department of\n Commerce] at the time the antidumping order is issued.\u201d\n 633 F. Supp. 1364, 1373 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1986). When the\n United States sought a stay pending appeal, the Trade\n Court denied the request, concluding that the judgment\n was not a monetary one subject to the automatic-stay prin-\n ciple. Badger-Powhatan, Div. of Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc. v. United\n States, 638 F. Supp. 344, 348 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1986). Unlike\n the judgment at issue in the present matter, however, the\n relevant part of the judgment in Badger-Powhatan did not\n simply order the government to pay an amount easily and\n objectively calculated, without further proceedings. In-\n deed, the Trade Court explained that \u201cthe final determina-\n tion and antidumping duty order will not result in the\n actual assessment of antidumping duties, rather importers\n will be required to deposit estimated antidumping duties.\n The permanent exchange of money will occur only after a\n\n\n\n Turkey on and after August 13, 2018 and to date has paid\n . . . $2,874,828.65 as a result of the 50% tariff.\u201d Transpa-\n cific Steel, No. 19-00009, ECF No. 19, Exhibit 3 (Ct.

The\n simple refund order at issue here is quite different.\n     Second, in National Association of Manufacturers v.\n United States Department of the Treasury, the Trade Court\n had before it a trade-association challenge to an agency\n rule, not individual importers\u2019 claims for a refund. 427 F.\n Supp. 3d 1362, 1366 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 2020). The Trade\n Court judgment declared the illegality of the agency\u2019s rule\n and then \u201c[d]eclare[d] that Defendants must process and\n pay substitution drawback claims that comply with the\n governing statutory and regulatory requirements.\u201d Nat\u2019l\n Ass\u2019n of Manufacturers v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 432 F.\n Supp. 3d 1381, 1382 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 2020). The Trade\n Court denied the government\u2019s request for a stay pending\n appeal, but all the court decided was that, under the tradi-\n tional four-factor analysis, the United States should not be\n granted a stay beyond a suspension of liquidations pending\n the appeal. See Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Manufacturers v. U.S. Dep\u2019t\n of the Treasury, No. 19-00053, 2020 WL 2519484, at *1\u20132\n (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade May 15, 2020). The Trade Court in Na-\n tional Association of Manufacturers simply never ad-\n dressed the automatic-stay principle\u2014and it was never\n asked to: In seeking a stay, the United States did not argue\n for a stay under the automatic-stay principle for money\n judgments. See No. 19-cv-00053, ECF No. 50 (Ct. Int\u2019l\n Trade Apr. 17, 2020). The denial of a stay in that case\n therefore has nothing to say about an automatic stay here.\n     In sum, I would conclude that the Trade Court\u2019s refund\n order in this case is a monetary judgment for purposes of\n the automatic-stay principle, thus rejecting the only basis\n on which plaintiffs challenge the government\u2019s request for\n an automatic stay without a bond.

Arguing\n that state sovereign immunity applies in IPR proceedings,\n UT filed motions to dismiss the petitions. The Patent Trial\n and Appeal Board (\u201cBoard\u201d), relying on Regents of the Uni-\n versity of Minnesota v. LSI Corp., 926 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir.\n 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 908 (2020), denied UT\u2019s mo-\n tions. UT appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A). See Univ. of Minn., 926 F.3d at 1331 n.2.\n      As UT recognizes, we held in University of Minnesota\n that \u201csovereign immunity does not apply to IPR proceed-\n ings when the patent owner is a state.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 9\n (citing Univ. of Minn., 926 F.3d at 1342). UT contends,\n however, that \u201cthe University of Minnesota panel applied\n the wrong standards and reached the wrong conclusion\n when it held\u201d that state sovereign immunity does not apply\n to IPR proceedings. Id. But, as UT also recognizes, \u201c[t]his\n panel is bound by the University of Minnesota decision.\u201d\n Reply Br. 1. Accordingly, we affirm the Board.\n                        AFFIRMED\n\f", "opinions_cited": [], "case_name": "Board of Regents of Ut v. Baylor College of Medicine"}]
