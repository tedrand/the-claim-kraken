Palo Alto Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., No.\n IPR2016-00151, Paper 68 (P.T.A.B. May 15, 2019), J.A. 1\u2013\n 7 (\u201cRemand FWD\u201d). 1 In the Remand FWD, the Board held\n that claims 1\u201312 of U.S. Patent No. 8,141,154 (\u201cthe \u2019154\n patent\u201d), owned by Finjan, Inc. (\u201cFinjan\u201d), had not been\n shown to be unpatentable in the inter partes review\n proceeding brought by Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (\u201cPalo\n Alto\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. 2\n\n\n\n     1    IPR2016-01071, filed by Symantec Corp. (\u201cSyman-\n tec\u201d), sought review of the same claims as, and was ulti-\n mately joined with, IPR2016-00151. Due to a previous\n settlement, Symantec is not a party to this appeal, and no\n argument is raised by the parties with respect to IPR2016-\n 01071. See Remand FWD at 1 n.1.\n     2    Initially, Palo Alto argued that we should vacate\n and remand the Remand FWD because it was rendered by\n an unconstitutionally appointed panel of Administrative\n Patent Judges, citing our court\u2019s decision in Arthrex, Inc. v.\n Smith & Nephew, Inc., 941 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Br. 49. The U.S. Patent & Trademark Office\n\fCase: 19-2151     Document: 61      Page: 3   Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v. FINJAN, INC.                  3\n\n\n\n                        BACKGROUND\n                               I\n     The \u2019154 patent relates to anti-virus protection for com-\n puters, and specifically, to protection against dynamically\n generated malicious code or viruses, which are viruses gen-\n erated at run-time. \u2019154 patent col. 3 ll. 33\u201338 & col. 8 ll.\n 38\u201340. The \u2019154 patent describes using a separate, re-\n motely-located security computer to inspect incoming con-\n tent to determine if it is safe to run the content on a client\n computer. Id. col. 4 ll. 35\u201354. More specifically, the \u2019154\n patent explains that when content is received at the client\n computer that includes \u201ca call to an original function\u201d and\n the call includes \u201can input to the function,\u201d the call to the\n original function is replaced with a \u201ccall to a substitute\n function.\u201d Id. col. 5 ll. 4\u201312. The substitute function causes\n the input to be sent to the security computer, which then\n determines whether it is safe for the client computer to in-\n voke the original function with the input. Id. col. 5 ll. 12\u2013\n 20. If the security computer determines it is safe, the orig-\n inal function can be invoked at the client computer with\n the input. Id. col. 5 ll. 22\u201325.\n     Independent claim 1 of the \u2019154 patent is representa-\n tive. It provides as follows:\n\n\n\n\n intervened with respect to this issue. The Supreme Court\n subsequently granted certiorari in Arthrex, 2020 WL\n 6037208 (Oct. 13, 2020), and Palo Alto then filed a motion\n to stay this appeal, which our court denied. As the peti-\n tioner before the Board in IPR2016-00151, Palo Alto has\n forfeited its right to an Arthrex challenge. See generally\n Ciena Corp. v. Oyster Optics, LLC, 958 F.3d 1157 (Fed. Cir.\n 2020).\n\fCase: 19-2151      Document: 61      Page: 4     Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                      PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.    v. FINJAN, INC.\n\n\n\n     1. A system for protecting a computer from dy-\n     namically generated malicious content, compris-\n     ing:\n     a content processor (i) for processing content re-\n     ceived over a network, the content including a call\n     to a first function, and the call including an input,\n     and (ii) for invoking a second function with the in-\n     put, only if a security computer indicates that such\n     invocation is safe;\n     a transmitter for transmitting the input to the se-\n     curity computer for inspection, when the first func-\n     tion is invoked; and\n     a receiver for receiving an indicator from the secu-\n     rity computer whether it is safe to invoke the sec-\n     ond function with the input.\n Id. col. 17 ll. 32\u201344 (emphasis added). The claimed \u201cfirst\n function\u201d refers to the substitute function, whereas the\n claimed \u201csecond function\u201d refers to the original function\n that the client computer has been asked to perform. Thus,\n the term at issue, \u201ca call to a first function,\u201d refers to a call\n to the substitute function that causes the input to be sent\n to a security computer for inspection.\n     The only prior art at issue is U.S. Patent Application\n Publication No. 2007/0113282 to Ross (\u201cRoss\u201d). Ross de-\n scribes systems and methods for detecting and disabling\n malicious script code. Specifically, Ross teaches a \u201chook\u201d-\n based detection engine that is configured to review script\n code associated with incoming data content and detect\n function calls in the script code. Ross \u00b6\u00b6 10, 25. The hook-\n base detection engine includes a hook script generator that\n creates new \u201chooked\u201d or \u201chook\u201d functions that replace the\n standard functions originally set forth in the script code,\n thereby replacing potentially malicious functions con-\n tained in the script code. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 26, 35. As discussed\n below, the issue on appeal is whether Ross discloses \u201ca call\n\fCase: 19-2151     Document: 61       Page: 5    Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v. FINJAN, INC.                    5\n\n\n\n to a first function,\u201d as recited in the \u2019154 patent and as con-\n strued by the Board.\n                                II\n     On March 15, 2017, the Board issued a Final Written\n decision in IPR2016-00151. Final Written Decision, Palo\n Alto Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., No. IPR2016-00151,\n 2017 WL 1040254 (P.T.A.B. Mar. 15, 2017) (\u201cOriginal\n FWD\u201d). In it, the Board construed \u201ca call to a first function\u201d\n to mean \u201ca statement or instruction in a program request-\n ing the services of a particular (i.e., first) function.\u201d Id. at\n *3\u20134. In the Original FWD, the Board determined that\n claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11 were patentable over Ross because\n Ross did not disclose the claimed \u201ccontent including a call\n to a first function.\u201d Id. at *5\u20138. 3 The Board rejected Palo\n Alto\u2019s argument that Ross\u2019s hook function teaches or sug-\n gests the \u201ccall to a first function.\u201d The Board concluded:\n \u201cRoss teaches assigning the original function to the hooked\n function. In that manner, Ross invokes indirectly the hook\n function without any need to include a call to that hook\n function.\u201d Id. at *7.\n      Palo Alto sought rehearing of the Original FWD be-\n cause the Board used different language in its construction\n of the term \u201ccall to a first function\u201d in a Final Written De-\n cision in IPR2015-01979, which issued the same day as the\n Original FWD and which also involved the \u2019154 patent. In\n the Final Written Decision in IPR2015-01979, the Board\n construed \u201ca call to a first function\u201d to mean \u201ca statement\n\n\n\n     3   Palo Alto\u2019s petition in IPR2016-00151 challenged\n claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11 of the \u2019154 patent as obvious under\n 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 over Ross and claims 9 and 12 as obvious\n over Ross and U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2002/0066022 to\n Calder (\u201cCalder\u201d). The Board instituted review of Palo\n Alto\u2019s challenge to claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11, but declined to\n institute its challenge to claims 9 and 12.\n\fCase: 19-2151     Document: 61     Page: 6    Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                     PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v.

Finjan, Inc., No. IPR2015-\n 01979, 2017 WL 1040259, at *7 (P.T.A.B. Mar. 15, 2017).\n The Board granted Palo Alto\u2019s Request for Rehearing, and\n agreed with Palo Alto \u201cthat the construction of \u2018a call to a\n first function\u2019 must be consistent with [its] determination\n in IPR2015-01979,\u201d specifically, that \u201ca call to a first func-\n tion\u201d means \u201ca statement or instruction in the content, the\n execution of which causes the function to provide a service.\u201d\n Decision on Petitioner\u2019s Request for Rehearing, Palo Alto\n Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., No. IPR2016-00151, 2017\n WL 2211715, at *1 (P.T.A.B. May 19, 2017) (\u201cRehearing\n Decision\u201d). The Board concluded, however, that the modi-\n fied construction was consistent with its prior analysis and\n did not require modification of its patentability determina-\n tions. Id. at *1\u20132. The Board stated: \u201c[W]e do not agree\n with [Palo Alto]\u2019s argument that this construction expands\n the scope of the term to include \u2018invocations\u2019 of a function\n when the \u2018call\u2019 is to another function.\u201d Id. at *1.\n      Palo Alto appealed the Original FWD and the Final\n Written Decision in IPR2015-01979. In a November 19,\n 2018 decision, our court issued an opinion in which we\n (1) affirmed the Board\u2019s construction of a disputed claim\n term in IPR2015-01979; and (2) vacated and remanded the\n Board\u2019s decision in IPR2016-00151 under SAS Institute\n Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348 (2018), because the Board had\n instituted IPR2016-00151 on less than all of the challenged\n claims. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. v. Finjan, Inc., 752 F.\n App\u2019x 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\n     On remand, the Board modified its institution decision\n to institute inter partes review of dependent claims 9 and\n 12. Remand FWD at 3, J.A. 3. The Board also \u201cadopt[ed]\n and incorporate[d] by reference, in its entirety, [its] previ-\n ous [Original FWD] that [Palo Alto] ha[d] not shown by a\n preponderance of the evidence that claims 1\u20138, 10, and 11\n of the \u2019154 patent are unpatentable\u201d and \u201creinstate[d],\n\fCase: 19-2151    Document: 61       Page: 7   Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v.

Remand FWD at 4, J.A. 4.\n The Board found that newly challenged claims 9 and 12\n had not been shown to be unpatentable because Palo Alto\n did not \u201cpoint to any teachings in Calder that teach the el-\n ements [the Board] found missing in Ross in reaching [its]\n decision that Ross did not render claims 1 and 10,\u201d from\n which claims 9 and 12 depend, \u201cobvious.\u201d Id. at 4\u20136.\n     Palo Alto now appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant\n to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A).\n                        DISCUSSION\n                               I\n     For petitions for inter partes review filed on or after\n November 13, 2018, the Board applies the Phillips district-\n court claim construction standard. 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.100(b)\n (2018); Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir.\n 2005) (en banc); Immunex Corp. v. Sanofi-Aventis U.S.\n LLC, 977 F.3d 1212, 1216 & n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2020). For peti-\n tions for inter partes review filed before November 13,\n 2018, like Palo Alto\u2019s, we apply the broadest reasonable in-\n terpretation claim construction standard.        37 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 42.100(b) (2012); AC Tech. S.A. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 912\n F.3d 1358, 1365 n.1 (Fed.

FINJAN, INC.\n\n\n\n                               II\n      As noted, the Board ultimately construed \u201ca call to a\n first function\u201d to mean \u201ca statement or instruction in the\n content, the execution of which causes the function to pro-\n vide a service.\u201d Rehearing Decision, 2017 WL2211715 at\n *1. This was the construction first stated in IPR2015-\n 01979.\n     In Palo Alto\u2019s view, the Board improperly added a lim-\n itation to the claims\u2014that the \u201ccall\u201d must directly name\n the first function\u2014when it construed the term as just\n stated and applied the construction to Ross. Palo Alto con-\n tends that the Board\u2019s original construction in IPR2016-\n 00151 (\u201ca statement or instruction in a program requesting\n the services of a particular (i.e., first) function\u201d) required\n that the first function be explicitly called, and when the\n Board modified the Original FWD in IPR2016-00151 to\n make the construction there consistent with the construc-\n tion in IPR2015-01979, the Board should have revisited its\n invalidity analysis under the new construction, which was\n not so limited. Appellant Br. 36\u201341.\n     According to Palo Alto, Ross teaches a \u201ccall to a first\n function\u201d through its description of the hook functions and\n their associated inputs. Id. at 43\u201348. For example, Palo\n Alto points out that Ross teaches \u201c[e]ach hook function is\n configured to supersede a corresponding original function\u201d\n and that \u201c[t]he hook function corresponding to the data\n content original function is executed when the original\n function is called.\u201d Id. at 44, 46 (quoting Ross \u00b6 10).\n      Finjan responds that Palo Alto\u2019s argument that the\n claim construction was not correctly applied is meritless\n because it \u201cignores the fundamental difference between a\n function call and the invocation of a function.\u201d Appellee\u2019s\n Br. 15. Finjan notes that Palo Alto does not challenge the\n Board\u2019s claim construction itself and indeed Palo Alto spe-\n cifically requested that the construction in IPR2015-01979\n be applied in IPR2016-00151.

Id. at\n 17\u201318, 20, 24.\n                               III\n     We have recognized a party\u2019s ability to challenge the\n Board\u2019s application of a claim construction. Respironics,\n Inc. v. Zoll Med. Corp., 656 F. App\u2019x 531, 535 (Fed. Cir.\n 2016) (first citing In re Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., 696 F.3d\n 1142, 1150-51 (Fed. Cir. 2012), then citing Intervet Inc. v.\n Merial Ltd., 617 F.3d 1282, 1289-90 (Fed. Cir. 2010)). \u201cOur\n analysis of this issue includes two components: first, we de-\n termine whether the Board added a limitation when it ap-\n plied the construction; second, we determine whether that\n limitation is appropriate under claim-construction law.\u201d\n Id.\n      Applying this test, we do not believe the Board added a\n direct-naming limitation when it applied its construction.\n Rather, the Board consistently explained that the term \u201ca\n call to a function\u201d is simply not equal to \u201cinvoking a func-\n tion.\u201d Original FWD, 2017 WL 1040254, at *4; Rehearing\n Decision, 2017 WL2211715 at *2. The Board explained\n that the term \u201ccall\u201d was used in the claims as a noun to\n mean a \u201cprogrammatic statement included in the content.\u201d\n Original FWD, 2017 WL 1040254 at *4; Rehearing Deci-\n sion, 2017 WL2211715 at *2 (\u201cThe word \u2018call\u2019 is recited in\n claim 1 as a noun, and is the statement or instruction in-\n cluded in the content . . . .\u201d). According to the Board, such\n a programmatic statement to a function must \u201ccause[ ]\n the . . . function to provide a service.\u201d Rehearing Decision,\n 2017 WL2211715 at *2 (\u201cThe word \u201ccall\u201d . . . is the state-\n ment or instruction included in the content that causes the\n first function to provide a service.\u201d). The Board also con-\n sistently explained that such a \u201ccall\u201d to a function does not\n encompass the invocation of a different function. Id. at *1\u2013\n\fCase: 19-2151    Document: 61      Page: 10    Filed: 12/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                   PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.   v. FINJAN, INC.\n\n\n\n 2; see Original FWD, 2017 WL 1040254 at *4. The Board\u2019s\n construction, and its application thereof, thus requires no\n more than what is recited in the claims: \u201c[t]he call to the\n first function must be included in the content, and it is the\n same first function that is invoked later in the claim.\u201d Id.\n at *4.\n     The Board found that Ross teaches a call to the original\n (second) function, in order to invoke the hook (first) func-\n tion, but does not teach a \u201ccall\u201d to the hook function. Id. at\n *6. This finding is supported by substantial evidence, in-\n cluding the testimony of Finjan\u2019s expert, see, e.g., Original\n FWD, 2017 WL 1040254, at *6, and the testimony of Palo\n Alto\u2019s expert that \u201cin the pseudocode in figure 4 [of Ross]\n there\u2019s no explicit call to a hooked function.\u201d Id. at *7.\n\n\n                         CONCLUSION\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Remand\n FWD. 4\n                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n      4 We have considered the other arguments raised by\n Palo Alto on appeal and have found them to be without\n merit.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4269448/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107160/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/152228/"], "case_name": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. v.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n\n    Before LOURIE, O\u2019MALLEY, and REYNA, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n     Cornell Howard appeals from the decision of the Court\n of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cthe Veterans Court\u201d) af-\n firming a decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cthe\n Board\u201d) denying service connection. See Howard v. Wilkie,\n No. 18-1487, 2019 WL 5598324 (Vet. App. Oct. 31, 2019)\n (\u201cDecision\u201d). Because Howard raises only factual issues\n over which we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\n                       BACKGROUND\n      Howard served on active duty in the Marine Corps\n from November 1975 to October 1976. Howard\u2019s entrance\n medical examination reported no abnormalities. Service\n Treatment Records (\u201cSTRs\u201d) reveal that Howard was\n treated for multiple abdominal issues during his service.\n In January 1976, Howard received treatment for an inter-\n mittent mid-epigastric dull ache. In May 1976, Howard re-\n ported to the emergency room complaining of severe\n abdominal pain. At the time of discharge a physician noted\n that the cause of the pain was of \u201cunknown etiology,\u201d and\n follow-up examination showed no abnormality. In Septem-\n ber 1976, Howard received treatment for a rash and nodule\n lump in his groin area. Howard was discharged in October\n 1976, and his separation examination was normal with no\n noted abnormalities relating to his abdomen or groin.\n     In November 1980, Howard sought disability compen-\n sation for a lower abdominal problem, claiming that he had\n undergone a hernia repair procedure after service in 1977\n at a Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) medical facility\n in St. Louis. Howard alleged that he was injured during a\n training exercise while carrying a military cannon which\n was abruptly dropped by other service members carrying\n the cannon, leaving Howard to hold onto the weapon that\n weighed several hundred pounds and causing his hernia\n\fCase: 20-1880     Document: 29    Page: 3    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n HOWARD   v. WILKIE                                        3\n\n\n\n injury. VA denied Howard\u2019s claim in 1984, finding that\n service records did not confirm the existence of any chronic\n disability, and Howard did not appeal.\n     In 2011, Howard filed another disability compensation\n claim for hernia residuals. Howard restated his claim that\n he had undergone a hernia operation in St. Louis and\n added allegations that the military physician who per-\n formed his separation exam told him he had a right ingui-\n nal hernia and that he had undergone a second hernia\n operation in Denver. VA unsuccessfully sought records of\n both procedures and issued a formal finding of unavailabil-\n ity of records. VA obtained a medical examination to de-\n termine whether Howard had a hernia disorder connected\n to his service. The examiner noted that Howard had a her-\n nia in the past and opined that the hernia was less likely\n than not incurred in or caused by Howard\u2019s claimed in-ser-\n vice injury, and VA denied service connection.\n      Howard appealed to the Board. The Board held a hear-\n ing during which he again reported that he injured himself\n lifting a cannon but also mentioned for the first time an\n injury while lifting a tree during basic training. The Board\n discounted the credibility of Howard\u2019s statements for lack\n of consistency and, relying on Howard\u2019s STRs and the 2012\n examination, denied service connection.\n      Howard appealed to the Veterans Court, which af-\n firmed the Board\u2019s decision. Specifically, the court found\n that VA satisfied its duty to assist Howard under 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 5103A because it sought records of his two alleged hernia\n operations even though the records ultimately proved una-\n vailable. Decision, 2019 WL 5598324, at *3. With respect\n to the cannon incident, the court concluded that the duty\n to assist did not extend to obtaining STRs of fellow Marines\n who were present at the time because \u201cthere is no apparent\n reason why the marines who served with Mr. Howard\n would not now corroborate a lifting injury if they witnessed\n it,\u201d and Howard was otherwise free to submit statements\n\fCase: 20-1880     Document: 29      Page: 4    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                             HOWARD   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n from them. Id. The court also held that the Board did not\n err in failing to address certain evidence provided by How-\n ard finding that the evidence was not relevant to whether\n Howard was injured during the lifting incident. Id. Fi-\n nally, the court found that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule,\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b), did not apply to Howard\u2019s claim be-\n cause the Board did not find that the evidence for and\n against in-service incurrence of Howard\u2019s injury was rela-\n tively equal. Id. at *4. Howard appealed.\n                          DISCUSSION\n     Our jurisdiction to review decisions of the Veterans\n Court is limited. We may review a decision of the Veterans\n Court with respect to a rule of law or interpretation of a\n statute or regulation relied on by the Veterans Court in its\n decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). However, except with re-\n spect to constitutional issues, we may not review chal-\n lenges to factual determinations or challenges to the\n application of a law or regulation to the facts of a case.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2).\n     On appeal, Howard principally argues that the Board\n and Veterans Court failed to consider relevant evidence.\n Specifically, Howard argues that the Board and Veterans\n Court failed to consider a document entitled \u201cDisposition of\n Diagnosis\u201d in his service medical records that lists \u201c7855\u201d\n as a diagnosis code related to the treatment he received in\n May 1976. Howard asserts that the code corresponds to a\n hernia diagnosis, which supports his contention that the\n cause of his May 1976 admission to the hospital for ab-\n dominal pain was a hernia, not unknown as determined by\n the Board. Howard also appears to argue that VA did not\n satisfy its duty to assist by failing adequately to investigate\n the cannon incident.\n     The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to\n review the Veterans Court\u2019s decision because Howard\n raises only factual issues on appeal. Specifically, the gov-\n ernment argues that the Board thoroughly considered the\n\fCase: 20-1880     Document: 29      Page: 5    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n HOWARD   v. WILKIE                                           5\n\n\n\n records regarding Howard\u2019s May 1976 treatment in con-\n cluding a lack of in-service incurrence of Howard\u2019s injury,\n and we lack jurisdiction to reweigh the evidence. Likewise,\n the government argues that whether VA satisfied its duty\n to assist is a factual issue that we lack authority to review.\n      We agree with the government. Regarding his May\n 1976 treatment, Howard\u2019s basic argument is that the\n Board gave too much weight to records indicating that\n Howard\u2019s abdominal pain was of \u201cunknown etiology\u201d and\n too little weight to the Disposition and Diagnosis form that\n may suggest that his condition was due to a hernia. But\n \u201c[t]he evaluation and weighing of evidence and the drawing\n of appropriate inferences from it are factual determina-\n tions committed to the discretion of the fact-finder,\u201d and we\n lack jurisdiction to reweigh evidence that has already been\n considered by the Board. Bastien v. Shinseki, 599 F.3d\n 1301, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2010). As the government points out,\n the document on which Howard relies was in the record be-\n fore the Board, and the Board is presumed to have consid-\n ered all evidence of record. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497\n F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The fact that the Board\n did not specifically refer to the document is insufficient to\n overcome this presumption.\n      With respect to Howard\u2019s argument that VA did not\n fulfill its duty to assist, we agree with the government that\n we lack jurisdiction to consider this issue. Whether VA has\n fulfilled its duty to assist is also a factual question that we\n lack jurisdiction to review. See Garrison v. Nicholson, 494\n F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, the Veterans Court\n concluded that Howard \u201chas not shown as clearly errone-\n ous the Board\u2019s determination that the duty to assist was\n satisfied,\u201d Decision, 2019 WL 5598324, at *3, and we can-\n not review the court\u2019s conclusion.\n\fCase: 20-1880   Document: 29      Page: 6    Filed: 12/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                           HOWARD   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n     We have considered Howard\u2019s remaining arguments\n but find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing reasons, we\n dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n                      DISMISSED\n                          COSTS\n    No costs.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/702/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/210448/"], "case_name": "Howard v.

CLS Bank Int\u2019l, 573 U.S.\n 208, 216 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA\n claim falls outside \u00a7 101 where (1) it is directed to a patent-\n ineligible concept, i.e., a law of nature, natural phenome-\n non, or abstract idea, and (2), if so, the particular elements\n of the claim, considered both individually and as an or-\n dered combination, do not add enough to transform the na-\n ture of the claim into a patent-eligible application.\u201d SAP,\n 898 F.3d at 1166\u201367 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                               A\n     Under the first step of the Alice framework, the district\n court concluded that the claims of the \u2019305 patent are di-\n rected to the abstract idea of \u201ccollecting information and\n transcoding it into multiple formats.\u201d Merits Opinion, 2019\n WL 7841923, at *3. That conclusion assumes for purposes\n of eligibility analysis that, despite the \u201cat least one client\n device\u201d language, which might suggest coverage of a sys-\n tem limited to sending to a single device, the claims re-\n quire, as suggested by at least the term \u201cbroadcast,\u201d the\n ability to send to multiple devices.

Cir. 2019) (quoting\n Affinity Labs of Texas, LLC v. DIRECTV, LLC, 838 F.3d\n 1253, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2016)). In this case, the claims and\n written description make clear that the focus of the claimed\n advance is the abstract idea of format conversion, from an\n incoming signal\u2019s format to a variety of formats suited to\n different destination devices. The focus is not any specific\n advance in coding or other techniques for implementing\n that idea; no such specific technique is required.\n     The written description, through material incorporated\n by reference, itself explains the familiarity of translation of\n content\u2014from a format (including a language) of a sender\n to one suited to a recipient\u2014as a fundamental communica-\n tion practice in both the electronic and pre-electronic\n worlds. J.A. 337\u201338. We have held that the ideas of encod-\n ing and decoding image data and of converting formats, in-\n cluding when data is received from one medium and sent\n along through another, are by themselves abstract ideas,\n and accordingly concluded that claims focused on those\n general ideas governing basic communication practices,\n not on any more specific purported advance in implemen-\n tation, were directed to abstract ideas.

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board\n affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejections. We affirm the Board.\n                               I\n      The \u2019235 application, filed on October 18, 2010, involves\n fixed-pitch wind or water turbines with centrifugal weight\n control. J.A. 30. For this appeal, the application\u2019s disclo-\n sures on wind turbines are most relevant. The application\n builds on Mr. Earley\u2019s \u2019842 patent and uses that earlier pa-\n tent\u2019s \u201ccontrol solution\u201d\u2014a centrifugal-weight-control as-\n sembly.      J.A. 31.     This application describes \u201can\n implementation\u201d that \u201cextend[s] the low speed shaft down\n the length of the tower\u201d of a wind turbine. J.A. 31. Accord-\n ing to the \u2019235 application, \u201cextending the low speed shaft\n down the length of the tower also means you can move\n other major components down, including [a] generator and\n [a] gearbox,\u201d resulting \u201cin several compelling advantages.\u201d\n J.A. 31. The centrifugal-weight-control \u201cconfiguration is\n horizontal (perpendicular to [the] vertical low speed\n shaft).\u201d J.A. 32.\n     Figure 1 illustrates the wind-turbine embodiment:\n\fCase: 20-1816     Document: 26     Page: 3    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                               3\n\n\n\n\n J.A. 35.\n      The specification asserts that this configuration is an\n improvement over the prior art.

By adjusting the location of the weights\n while the overall assembly rotates, the centrifugal-weight-\n control assembly can maintain the wind turbine\u2019s operat-\n ing speed while increasing rolling torque, which allows\n generators to capture energy. Id. The general concept is\n similar to changing gears on a bike. Unlike the \u2019235 appli-\n cation, the centrifugal-weight-control assembly of the \u2019842\n patent is essentially parallel to the blades of a wind turbine\n and not connected to a vertical shaft.\n     Figure 1 shows the placement of the assembly:\n\fCase: 20-1816      Document: 26   Page: 6    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                              IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n \u2019842 patent, fig. 1.\n      Carter: \u201cWind Turbine with Governor.\u201d Carter \u201cgener-\n ally relates to a wind driven turbine assembly for driving a\n generator or generators in a manner to produce electrical\n energy in response to rotation of the wind turbine.\u201d Carter,\n col. 1, lines 6\u20139.

Simon also describes a multi-geared\n transmission, namely, \u201ca transmission 30 selectable be-\n tween at least two gear ratios, for example[,] a three (or\n more) speed transmission, coupled between the turbine 10\n for receiving wind energy and at least one generator 36 in\n the power conversion module 18.\u201d Id., \u00b6 30.\n                              B\n     On January 6, 2017, the examiner issued Mr. Earley a\n final rejection of claims 26\u201329 for obviousness over the\n combination of the \u2019842 patent, Carter, and Simon. J.A.\n 598 (Final Rejection). The examiner determined that the\n \u2019842 patent disclosed all claim elements except (1) an ex-\n tended vertical shaft, (2) a gearbox with a multi-geared\n transmission, and (3) an induction-type generator. J.A.\n 598\u201399. As to \u201can extended vertical shaft,\u201d the examiner\n concluded that \u201c[i]t would have been obvious to one skilled\n in the art at the time the invention was made to use the\n extended vertical shaft disclosed by Carter on the support-\n ing tower disclosed by [the \u2019842 patent] for the purpose of\n providing mechanical power to a generator located at the\n base of a tower.\u201d J.A. 600. As to \u201ca gearbox with a multi-\n geared transmission\u201d and \u201can induction-type generator,\u201d\n the examiner determined:\n        It would have also been obvious to one skilled\n    in the art at the time the invention was made to\n    use the multi-speed transmission (in lieu of the\n    multi-geared transmission disclosed by [the \u2019842\n    patent]) and an induction generator (in lieu of the\n    generator disclosed by [the \u2019842 patent] or the gen-\n    erator disclosed by Carter) disclosed by Simon on\n\fCase: 20-1816     Document: 26      Page: 9    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                                 9\n\n\n\n     the wind turbine disclosed by [the \u2019842 patent] for\n     the purpose of providing multiple high-speed out-\n     puts instead of a single high-speed output from the\n     transmission and providing \u201ca cost-effective ma-\n     chine for converting the rotational energy to electric-\n     ity.\u201d\n J.A. 600 (quoting Simon, \u00b6 26).\n      On November 14, 2019, the Board affirmed the exam-\n iner\u2019s rejections. Ex parte Earley, 2019 Pat. App. LEXIS\n 10527, *2 (P.T.A.B. November 14, 2019). In reaching that\n result, the Board rejected three arguments. The Board\n first explained that the \u2019842 patent\u2019s \u201cwind turbine in-\n cludes the same structural elements that [Mr. Earley] dis-\n closes are responsible for the functional limitations recited\n in claim 26\u2019s preamble.\u201d Id. at *9\u201310 (citation omitted).\n For that reason, explained the Board, \u201cthe burden was on\n [Mr. Earley] to show that [the \u2019842 patent\u2019s] wind turbine\n as modified by the suggestions in the other prior art refer-\n ences would not inherently perform the same function re-\n cited in claim 26.\u201d Id. at *10. Because Mr. Earley did not\n \u201cdirect\u201d the Board \u201cto any objective evidence,\u201d he did not\n meet the burden. Id. Next, the Board rejected Mr. Earley\u2019s\n challenge of the motivation to combine the three prior-art\n references. The Board accepted the examiner\u2019s explana-\n tion that a relevant artisan would have used the vertical\n shaft taught in Carter \u201cfor the purpose of providing me-\n chanical power to a generator located at the base of a\n tower.\u201d Id. at *5\u20136. As to Simon, the Board found that a\n relevant artisan \u201cwould have implemented an induction\n generator in [the \u2019842 patent] for the purpose of providing,\n inter alia, a cost-effective machine for converting the rota-\n tional energy to electricity.\u201d Id. at *11\u201312. Last, the Board\n rejected Mr. Earley\u2019s contention that the \u2019235 application\u2019s\n claimed invention achieves unexpected results. Id. at *12\u2013\n 13. The Board reasoned that Mr. Earley did \u201cnot direct us\n to objective, experimental data comparing the claimed\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26     Page: 10    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                             IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n invention against the closest prior art,\u201d so his argument\n was \u201cunsupported\u201d and \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d Id. at *12.\n     Mr. Earley requested a rehearing, arguing that the\n Board relied on a new ground of rejection. On January 27,\n 2020, the Board maintained its affirmance of the exam-\n iner\u2019s rejection, but because of Mr. Earley\u2019s \u201cpro se status\n and the complex nature of this prosecution,\u201d the Board\n thought it was \u201cappropriate to designate [its earlier] affir-\n mance as a new ground of rejection pursuant to 37 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 41.50(b).\u201d Ex parte Earley, Appeal 2019-000815, 2020\n WL 489476, at *3 (P.T.A.B. Jan. 27, 2020). Based on that\n designation, the Board gave Mr. Earley two options to ad-\n dress the ground: reopen prosecution or request a rehear-\n ing. Id.\n      Mr. Earley chose to request a rehearing. On March 11,\n 2020, the Board denied that (second) request for rehearing\n on the merits. Ex parte Earley, Appeal 2019-000815, 2020\n WL 1286056, at *2\u20133 (P.T.A.B. Mar. 11, 2020). Mr. Earley\n contended that Simon\u2019s induction generator could not meet\n the capability in the preamble because \u201c[a]n induction gen-\n erator with a 12 m/s rating would render the claimed in-\n vention inoperable for its intended use\u2014i.e., where [t]he\n claimed invention is unique in its ability to generate in-\n creasing amounts of energy through 24 m/s.\u201d Id. at *1 (in-\n ternal quotation marks omitted). The Board rejected that\n contention because it was \u201cnot supported by objective evi-\n dence (e.g., a sworn declaration).\u201d Id. Mr. Earley also as-\n serted that the \u2019842 patent\u2019s centrifugal-weight-control\n assembly would \u201cinherently\u201d act as \u201ca very large air brake,\u201d\n causing the capability requirement of the new application\u2019s\n preamble not to be met. Id. at *2. The Board rejected the\n assertion, stating that it was \u201cbased merely on conclusory\n statements that are not accompanied by any objective evi-\n dence (e.g., declaration evidence) providing detailed specif-\n ics of the systems used for comparison.\u201d Id.\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26       Page: 11   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                             11\n\n\n\n     Mr. Earley timely appealed.

The\n ultimate obviousness determination under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n is a matter of law based on underlying factual findings,\n which include \u201cthe scope and content of the prior art, the\n differences between the prior art and the claimed inven-\n tion, the level of ordinary skill in the art, the presence or\n absence of a motivation to combine or modify with a rea-\n sonable expectation of success, and objective indicia of non-\n obviousness.\u201d Ariosa Diagnostics v. Verinata Health, Inc.,\n 805 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2015). We review the\n Board\u2019s ultimate obviousness determination de novo and\n its underlying factual findings for substantial-evidence\n support. In re Varma, 816 F.3d 1352, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016).\n Our review for substantial-evidence support \u201cask[s]\n whether a reasonable fact finder could have arrived at the\n agency\u2019s decision, which requires examination of the record\n as a whole, taking into account evidence that both justifies\n and detracts from an agency\u2019s decision.\u201d Personal Web\n Technologies, LLC v.

Second, Mr. Earley as-\n serts that the \u2019842 patent\u2019s centrifugal-weight-control\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26      Page: 12    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                                              IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n assembly is \u201cvery different\u201d from the claimed invention and\n would not have the preamble-required capability. Op. Br.\n 8. We reject these contentions.\n     At the core of these contentions, which focus as a sub-\n stantive matter on a reasonable expectation of success, is a\n challenge to the Board\u2019s demand for objective evidence. We\n address that challenge through the framework applicable\n during prosecution (in contrast to district-court litigation).\n \u201c[T]he concept of prima facie obviousness establishes the\n framework for the obviousness determination and the bur-\n dens the parties face\u201d during patent examination. ACCO\n Brands Corp. v. Fellowes, Inc., 813 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed.\n Cir. 2016); see also In re Brandt, 886 F.3d 1171, 1176 (Fed.\n Cir. 2018) (describing the prima facie framework as well).\n \u201cUnder this framework, the patent examiner must first set\n forth a prima facie case, supported by evidence, showing\n why the claims at issue would have been obvious in light of\n the prior art.\u201d ACCO Brands, 813 F.3d at 1365. \u201cOnce the\n examiner sets out this prima facie case, the burden shifts\n to the patentee to provide evidence, in the prior art or be-\n yond it, or argument sufficient to rebut the examiner\u2019s evi-\n dence.\u201d Id. at 1365\u201366. \u201cThe examiner then reaches the\n final determination on obviousness by weighing the evi-\n dence establishing the prima facie case with the rebuttal\n evidence.\u201d Id. at 1366. \u201cIf this weighing shows obviousness\n by a preponderance of the evidence, then the claims at is-\n sue were unpatentable.\u201d Id. \u201cThis burden-shifting frame-\n work makes sense during patent examination because an\n examiner typically has no knowledge of objective consider-\n ations, and those considerations \u2018may not be available until\n years after an application is filed.\u2019\u201d In re Brandt, 886 F.3d\n at 1176.\n     \u201cThe reasonable expectation of success requirement re-\n fers to the likelihood of success in combining references to\n meet the limitations of the claimed invention.\u201d Intelligent\n Bio-Systems, Inc. v.

Mr. Earley disputes that\n finding because Simon\u2019s generator could not be physically\n combined with the \u2019842 patent. But the correct inquiry is\n not limited to \u201can actual, physical substitution of ele-\n ments\u201d; \u201cthe test for obviousness is what the combined\n teachings of the references would have suggested to\u201d a rel-\n evant artisan.

Mr. Earley repeatedly notes that Si-\n mon\u2019s specification is in miles per hour rather than meters\n per second. See Op. Br. 1 (\u201cExaminer does err when he fails\n to understand that the quantitative work found in the prior\n art of Simon is accomplished in mph (miles per hour) and\n not m/s (meters per second).\u201d); see also Op. Br. 3\u20134. To the\n extent that Mr. Earley suggests that the Board\u2019s finding\n fails because a relevant artisan would not convert the units\n from mph to m/s based on a very simple multiplicative re-\n lationship, he has not pointed to any evidence to support\n that implausible suggestion. Mr. Earley otherwise relies\n on aspects of Simon\u2019s specific induction generator, but that\n reliance does not undermine the Board\u2019s finding that a rel-\n evant artisan would alter Simon\u2019s specific generator to\n achieve the 25 m/s capability.\n                              2\n     Mr. Earley argues that the Board erred in failing to ac-\n cept his assertion that a relevant artisan would not have a\n reasonable expectation of success in using the \u2019842 patent\u2019s\n disclosure of a centrifugal weight control. Mr. Earley gives\n two reasons. We find neither sufficient to show error.\n     First, Mr. Earley asserts that using the \u2019842 patent\u2019s\n centrifugal-weight-control assembly on a vertical shaft\n would render the combination \u201cinoperable.\u201d Op. Br. 6\u20137.\n Specifically, Mr. Earley asserts that \u201c[t]he jackscrews and\n guides\u201d of the \u2019842 patent could not \u201csupport the amount of\n weight that is called for\u201d in the claimed invention. Op. Br.\n 7. The Board properly rejected this assertion as \u201cbased\n merely on conclusory statements that are not accompanied\n by any objective evidence (e.g., declaration evidence)\n providing detailed specifics of the systems used for compar-\n ison.\u201d Ex parte Earley, 2020 WL 1286056, at *2. The Board\n also properly explained that Mr. Earley\u2019s arguments about\n what the \u2019842 patent\u2019s centrifugal-weight-control assembly\n could not do relied on properties or features not actually\n required by claim 26\u2014\u201ce.g., a limitation on air brake size,\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26     Page: 15    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: EARLEY                                             15\n\n\n\n the exclusion of an aerodynamic means, a [centrifugal-\n weight-control] diameter, ability to extend or retract\n weights totaling eight thousand pounds, or induction gen-\n erator rating.\u201d Id. at *2.\n     Second, Mr. Earley contends that a relevant artisan\n would \u201ccertainly see\u201d the centrifugal-weight-control assem-\n bly in the \u2019842 patent as an \u201cair brake\u201d that would cause a\n \u201cdrag force,\u201d preventing the combined prior art from having\n the capability required by claim 26\u2019s preamble. Op. Br. 8;\n Reply Br. 4. Like his arguments for Simon\u2019s induction gen-\n erator, Mr. Earley\u2019s contention addresses the wrong ques-\n tion. It focuses only on the specific apparatus of the \u2019842\n patent. It does not undermine the Board\u2019s finding about\n the \u2019842 patent\u2019s overall teachings on the centrifugal-\n weight-control assembly and Carter\u2019s teachings on the lo-\n cation of the assembly, among other components, at the\n base of the support staff.\n                              B\n      Mr. Earley also presents two challenges to the Board\u2019s\n inherency reasoning in finding that the combination of the\n prior-art teachings would be a structure having the capa-\n bility required by claim 26\u2019s preamble. We reject both chal-\n lenges.\n                              1\n      Mr. Earley argues that the Board issued a new ground\n of rejection when, in rejecting his second request for re-\n hearing on the merits, the Board stated: \u201calthough we ap-\n preciate that claim 26\u2019s preamble language recites a new\n capability rather than merely an intended use, this capa-\n bility was already disclosed in [the \u2019842 patent] . . . .\u201d Ex\n parte Earley, 2020 WL 1286056, at *1; Op.

Mr. Earley\n had such an opportunity in his second rehearing.\n     In its first rehearing decision, the Board specifically ex-\n plained how the examiner properly \u201cpointed out that a\n claim to an apparatus must be distinguished patentably\n from the prior art in terms of structure rather than func-\n tion\u201d\u2014the same point made in the second rehearing deci-\n sion.

A party must instead \u201cshow\n that the natural result flowing from the operation as\n taught would result in the performance of the questioned\n function.\u201d Id.\n     In the present case, the Board stated that Mr. Earley\u2019s\n own application points to certain structural features as re-\n sponsible for the preamble-required functional capability,\n that the \u2019842 patent (being combined with teachings from\n Carter and Simon) had the same structural features, and\n that the combination therefore would have the functional\n capability, unless objective evidence showed otherwise:\n          Because [the \u2019842 patent] wind turbine in-\n     cludes the same structural elements that [Mr. Ear-\n     ley\u2019s present application] discloses are responsible\n     for the functional limitations recited in claim 26\u2019s\n     preamble, the burden was on [Mr. Earley] to show\n     that [the \u2019842 patent\u2019s] wind turbine as modified by\n     the suggestions in the other prior art references\n     would not inherently perform the same function re-\n     cited in claim 26. [Mr. Earley] does not direct us to\n     any objective evidence in satisfaction of meeting\n     that burden.\n Ex parte Earley, 2019 Pat. App. LEXIS 10527, at *9\u201310.\n That inherency reasoning is proper under the prima facie\n framework.\n     Indeed, the Board needs only a \u201csound basis for believ-\n ing\u201d that the combined teachings of the prior art\u2019s structure\n results in the functional limitation. In re Spada, 911 F.2d\n 705, 708 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (\u201c[W]hen the PTO shows sound\n basis for believing that the products of the applicant and\n the prior art are the same, the applicant has the burden of\n showing that they are not.\u201d); see also In re Ikeda Food\n\fCase: 20-1816    Document: 26      Page: 18   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18                                            IN RE: EARLEY\n\n\n\n\n Research Co., Ltd., 758 F.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n                  ______________________\n\n    Before DYK, MOORE, and O\u2019MALLEY, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n      Mark Jackson appeals the decision of the United\n States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans\n Court\u201d) that dismissed his petitions for extraordinary relief\n in the nature of a writ of mandamus. We dismiss in part\n and affirm in part.\n                        BACKGROUND\n      Mr. Jackson served on active duty from July 1989 to\n July 1993. After discharge, Mr. Jackson applied for reim-\n bursement for the cost of a computer and Vocational Reha-\n bilitation and Education (\u201cVRE\u201d) benefits under Chapter\n 31, Title 38, of the United States Code. In August 2005,\n the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Regional Office\n denied Mr. Jackson\u2019s claim for reimbursement for the com-\n puter. In March 2006, the Regional Office denied Mr. Jack-\n son\u2019s claim for VRE benefits.\n     Mr. Jackson appealed the August 2005 and March\n 2006 decisions to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d).\n In a decision issued on August 4, 2014, the Board affirmed\n the denial of reimbursement for the computer but granted\n the appeal as to the VRE benefits and remanded to the Re-\n gional Office to provide VRE benefits to Mr. Jackson.\n      Between January 2015 and July 2015, the Regional Of-\n fice reopened Mr. Jackson\u2019s case and provided VRE ser-\n vices,    including by      meeting    with Mr. Jackson\n telephonically and drafting for Mr. Jackson a plan for vo-\n cational rehabilitation. After July 2015, the Regional Of-\n fice lost contact with Mr. Jackson, who did not respond to\n the Regional Office\u2019s multiple attempts to contact\n Mr. Jackson between August 2015 and January 2017. On\n April 3, 2017, the Regional Office closed Mr. Jackson\u2019s file\n\fCase: 20-1679     Document: 59     Page: 3    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n JACKSON   v. WILKIE                                        3\n\n\n\n due to Mr. Jackson\u2019s lack of response to multiple contact\n attempts.\n     On August 11, 2019, and September 8, 2019, Mr. Jack-\n son filed petitions for extraordinary relief in the nature of\n a writ of mandamus. The petitions appeared to seek en-\n forcement of the Board\u2019s 2014 remand decision with re-\n spect to VRE benefits, \u201creimbursement for a computer,\u201d\n and relief for matters not related to the implementation of\n veterans benefits provided by the VA, such as \u201can order re-\n storing his Florida truck driver\u2019s license.\u201d App\u2019x 1. 1\n     The Veterans Court determined that it had jurisdiction\n only over Mr. Jackson\u2019s petitions to enforce the Board\u2019s Au-\n gust 2014 decision. The Veterans Court further deter-\n mined that because the Regional Office had reopened\n Mr. Jackson\u2019s VRE case and provided services, \u201cthe relief\n requested in his petitions [had] been provided,\u201d and there\n was no continuing case or controversy that the Veterans\n Court had jurisdiction over. App\u2019x 2. The Veterans Court\n accordingly dismissed Mr. Jackson\u2019s petitions as moot.\n     Mr. Jackson appeals.\n                         DISCUSSION\n      First, we conclude that we have no jurisdiction over\n Mr. Jackson\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of his petitions as\n moot. We have limited jurisdiction to review appeals of de-\n cisions by the Veterans Court. Wanless v. Shinseki, 618\n F.3d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Except to the extent that\n an appeal presents a constitutional issue, we may not re-\n view a challenge to a factual determination by the Veterans\n Court. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Mr. Jackson contends that\n his petitions are not moot, arguing that the delay between\n the original Regional Office decisions in 2005 and 2006 and\n\n\n\n     1 \u201cApp\u2019x\u201d refers to the appendix attached to the gov-\n ernment\u2019s response brief.\n\fCase: 20-1679     Document: 59      Page: 4    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                             JACKSON   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n the Board decision in 2014 \u201cput [him] in the position where\n . . . [he had] too many college credits to transfer to another\n school.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Mem. in Lieu Oral Arg. 1\u20133. This is a\n challenge to the Veterans Court\u2019s factual determination\n that the Regional Office had complied with the Board\u2019s\n 2014 remand order, which we have no jurisdiction to re-\n view. Mr. Jackson also argues that his petitions for en-\n forcement of the Board\u2019s 2014 remand order raises\n questions under the Fourteenth Amendment, but his\n \u201ccharacterization of that question as constitutional in na-\n ture does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise\n lack.\u201d Flores v. Nicholson, 476 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir.\n 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Helfer v.\n West, 174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).\n     Second, we affirm the dismissal of Mr. Jackson\u2019s ap-\n peal of the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal of the writ as to the\n reimbursement for a computer. \u201cThis court has jurisdiction\n to review the [Veterans Court\u2019s] decision whether to grant\n a mandamus petition that raises a non-frivolous legal ques-\n tion . . . .\u201d Beasley v. Shinseki, 709 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed.\n Cir. 2013). In our review, \u201cwe may determine whether the\n petitioner has satisfied the legal standard for issuing the\n writ.\u201d Id. To obtain mandamus, Mr. Jackson must show\n that he \u201ccannot adequately protect his rights through the\n normal appellate process.\u201d Lamb v. Principi, 284 F.3d\n 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \u201c[T]he extraordinary writs\n cannot be used as substitutes for appeals . . . .\u201d Id. (altera-\n tion in original) (citation omitted). Mr. Jackson\u2019s reim-\n bursement claim for a computer has not been properly\n appealed, and mandamus cannot be used \u201cas a substitute\n for the regular appeals process.\u201d Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct.\n for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2004).\n     Third, we affirm as to the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal\n of the petitions seeking relief for claims that do not relate\n to implementation of veterans benefits.          We review\n whether the Veterans Court \u201cproperly declined to assert ju-\n risdiction\u201d de novo. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1358\n\fCase: 20-1679     Document: 59      Page: 5   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n JACKSON   v. WILKIE                                         5\n\n\n\n (Fed. Cir. 2002). \u201c[T]he Veterans Court has jurisdiction to\n review Secretary decisions, appealed from the Board, made\n \u2018under a law\u2019 affecting the provision of [VA-provided] bene-\n fits.\u201d Burris v. Wilkie, 888 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\n The Veterans Court correctly determined here that it\n lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Jackson\u2019s claims that do not\n relate to implementation of veterans benefits.\n                         CONCLUSION\n    We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the appeal of the Vet-\n erans Court\u2019s mootness decision. We affirm the Veterans\n Court in all other respects.\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART\n                            COSTS\n     No costs.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/175105/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/210787/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/763546/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/777085/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/136997/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/778979/"], "case_name": "Jackson v.

Ap-\n pellant Mary A. Paredez appeals the decision of the United\n States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissing in\n part and affirming in part her appeal from the Board of\n Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision denying (1) entitlement to an\n initial disability rating in excess of 40 percent for fibrom-\n yalgia on a schedular or an extraschedular basis; (2) a dis-\n ability rating in excess of 50 percent for dysthymic disorder\n with anxiety; (3) an effective date earlier than Novem-\n ber 27, 2015, for the award of entitlement to disability com-\n pensation for fibromyalgia; and (4) a total disability rating\n based on individual unemployability (TDIU). Paredez v.\n Wilkie, No. 19-5401, 2020 WL 3163606 (Vet. App. June 15,\n 2020) (Memorandum Decision). For the reasons discussed\n below, we dismiss-in-part and affirm-in-part.\n                               I\n      Ms. Paredez served on active duty in the U.S. Army\n from December 1982 to December 1990. Immediately fol-\n lowing her discharge from military service, Ms. Paredez\n filed a claim for disability compensation for fibromyalgia.\n A VA regional office (RO) denied disability compensation\n for fibromyalgia in July 1991. That decision was not ap-\n pealed and became final.\n     In April 2012, the RO awarded entitlement to disability\n compensation for dysthymic disorder with anxiety and as-\n signed a 30 percent disability rating effective from April\n 2011. In June 2016, Ms. Paredez submitted a statement\n from her physician which indicated that Ms. Paredez had\n to retire from her job in the postal service because of her\n fibromyalgia. VA also received records reflecting a denial\n\fCase: 20-2062      Document: 18     Page: 3   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE                                         3\n\n\n\n of her Social Security disability claim based on fibromyal-\n gia and other claimed conditions. Memorandum Decision\n at *1\u20132.\n     The RO issued a rating decision in July 2016 awarding\n entitlement to disability compensation for fibromyalgia\n with a 40 percent disability rating and increasing the rat-\n ing for dysthymic disorder with anxiety from 30 percent to\n 50 percent, both effective November 2015. Ms. Paredez ap-\n pealed, and the RO denied entitlement to a disability rat-\n ing in excess of 50 percent for dysthymic disorder with\n anxiety, a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for fi-\n bromyalgia, an earlier effective date, service connection for\n fibromyalgia, and TDIU. Ms. Paredez appealed that deci-\n sion to the Board. On July 16, 2019, the Board also denied\n those entitlements. The Board also found that Ms. Paredez\n had raised an issue of clear and unmistakable error (CUE)\n in prior rating decisions and referred the matter to the\n agency for a determination. Id. at *2.\n     Ms. Paredez appealed to the Veterans Court, which af-\n firmed the Board\u2019s decision, including the Board\u2019s denial of\n a higher rating for fibromyalgia on an extraschedular basis.\n The Veterans Court dismissed the portions of\n Ms. Paredez\u2019s appeal concerning the Board\u2019s denial of enti-\n tlement to an increased disability rating for fibromyalgia\n on a schedular basis and the issue of CUE. Id. at *1.\n Ms. Paredez timely appealed to this court.\n                               II\n     The scope of this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions\n by the Veterans Court is narrow. We may review decisions\n by the Veterans Court \u201con a rule of law or of any statute or\n regulation . . . or any interpretation thereof (other than a\n determination as to a factual matter)\u201d that the Veterans\n Court relied on in making its decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a).\n But this court lacks jurisdiction to review \u201ca challenge to a\n factual determination\u201d or the application of law to fact un-\n less the appeal presents a constitutional issue. 38 U.S.C.\n\fCase: 20-2062    Document: 18     Page: 4    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                           PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2); see also Cook v. Principi, 353 F.3d 937, 939\n (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n                              A\n     Ms. Paredez states in her informal opening brief and\n reply brief that her appeal challenges the Veterans Court\u2019s\n interpretation of a statute, regulation, or constitutional\n provision. Appellant\u2019s Br. 2. 1 However, Ms. Paredez does\n not identify which rules of law, statutes, regulations, or\n constitutional provisions the Veterans Court relied upon.\n And the Veterans Court\u2019s decision she appeals from does\n not appear to concern the interpretation of any of the same.\n Instead, the Veterans Court reviewed the Board\u2019s factual\n determinations concerning the proper effective date and\n disability ratings, including entitlement to TDIU and ex-\n traschedular evaluations, for clear error and applied estab-\n lished law to the particular facts of Ms. Paredez\u2019s case.\n Memorandum Decision at *4\u20137. In so doing, the Veterans\n Court did not elaborate on the meaning of any rule of law,\n statute, or regulation. We cannot exercise jurisdiction\n without such an issue of legal interpretation to review.\n Githens v. Shinseki, 676 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n Because Ms. Paredez\u2019s appeal raises only factual issues as\n to the Veterans Court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s denial of\n entitlement to a higher rating for fibromyalgia on an ex-\n traschedular basis, a higher rating for dysthymic disorder,\n an earlier effective date, and TDIU, we dismiss that portion\n of her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n                              B\n    Additionally, we liberally construe Ms. Paredez\u2019s infor-\n mal briefs to challenge the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal of\n\n\n    1   Citations to Ms. Paredez\u2019s informal brief and reply\n brief (and the pages and documents included therein) re-\n flect the pagination applied by this court\u2019s electronic case\n files system, Docket Nos. 3 and 10, respectively.\n\fCase: 20-2062      Document: 18    Page: 5    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE                                        5\n\n\n\n the portion of her appeal concerning the Board\u2019s denial of\n entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of\n 40 percent on a schedular basis. Appellant\u2019s Br. 2\u20133. In\n dismissing that part of her appeal, the Veterans Court did\n not cite to or elaborate on the meaning of any legal provi-\n sion, but simply applied the well-established jurispruden-\n tial rule that issues not raised by an appellant are\n considered abandoned. Memorandum Decision at *1.\n     Ms. Paredez asserts that she could not have abandoned\n her appeal of the Board\u2019s denial of entitlement to a higher\n rating for fibromyalgia on a schedular basis because the\n Veterans Court recited that claim in its summary of the\n Board decision being appealed from. Appellant\u2019s Br. 2\u20133;\n Memorandum Decision at *1. However, merely appealing\n from a decision does not raise every issue in that decision\n on appeal. In order to adequately raise an argument, an\n appellant must develop the argument before the Veterans\n Court. We have repeatedly affirmed the Veterans Court\u2019s\n application of this maxim in dismissing veterans\u2019 appeals\n where, as here, even after liberally interpreting an appel-\n lant\u2019s informal brief, the Veterans Court can discern no ar-\n gument regarding an issue. See e.g., Gaines v. McDonald,\n 589 Fed. Appx. 993, 995 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Andre v. Prin-\n cipi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1362\u201363 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n      Liberally construed, Ms. Paredez\u2019s informal briefs chal-\n lenge only the Veterans Court\u2019s application of that princi-\n ple to the facts of her case. However, we lack jurisdiction\n to review the application of law to facts. 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the\n Veterans Court\u2019s determination that Ms. Paredez had\n abandoned the issue of entitlement to an increased disabil-\n ity rating for fibromyalgia on a schedular basis and we dis-\n miss that portion of her appeal.\n                              C\n     Finally, Ms. Paredez argues that the Veterans Court\n erred by concluding it lacked jurisdiction to review her\n\fCase: 20-2062    Document: 18       Page: 6    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                             PAREDEZ   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n claim of CUE. Appellant\u2019s Br. 3. We have jurisdiction to\n review the Veterans Court\u2019s determination that it lacked\n jurisdiction over Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim because that\n challenge concerns the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of\n its jurisdictional statute, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7252(a). Andre,\n 301 F.3d at 1358.\n     We find that the Veterans Court properly determined\n that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim\n because the Board referred that claim to the agency and\n the Veterans Court has jurisdiction to \u201creview referred\n matters only to the extent that the appellant argues that\n remand, rather than referral, was appropriate.\u201d Memoran-\n dum Decision at *1. The Board has not yet decided\n Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim\u2014instead, that claim has been re-\n ferred to the agency for further development. The Veterans\n Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to reviewing final decisions\n of the Board. Howard v. Gober, 220 F.3d 1341, 1344\n (Fed. Cir. 2000). If VA ultimately concludes that CUE does\n not exist as to the relevant prior rating decisions,\n Ms. Paredez may appeal that determination to the Board\n at that time. We therefore affirm the Veterans Court\u2019s dis-\n missal of Ms. Paredez\u2019s CUE claim for lack of jurisdiction.\n                              III\n      Because we lack jurisdiction to review the issues raised\n by Ms. Paredez in her appeal, we dismiss as to: 1) the Vet-\n erans Court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s denial of entitle-\n ment to a higher initial disability rating for fibromyalgia\n on an extraschedular basis, a higher disability rating for\n dysthymic disorder with anxiety, an earlier effective date\n for the award of entitlement to disability compensation for\n fibromyalgia, and TDIU; and 2) the Veterans Court\u2019s dis-\n missal of her appeal as to the Board\u2019s denial of entitlement\n to a higher disability rating for fibromyalgia on a schedular\n basis. We affirm the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal of\n Ms. Paredez\u2019s appeal concerning the issue of CUE.\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART\n\fCase: 20-2062      Document: 18    Page: 7   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n PAREDEZ   v.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n                  ______________________\n\n    Before NEWMAN, LOURIE, and HUGHES, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n     Paul Wright, a veteran of the United States Navy, ap-\n peals the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for\n Veterans Claims in Wright v. Wilkie, No. 19-5244, 2019 WL\n 6138462 (Vet. App. Nov. 20, 2019) (Decision). Appellant\u2019s\n Br. 3\u20135. 1 The Veterans Court found that there was an\n available alternative means to secure Mr. Wright\u2019s re-\n quested relief because his claims were still pending before\n the Department of Veterans Affairs and therefore denied\n his petition for a writ of mandamus. Id. Mr. Wright argues\n that, in denying his petition, the Board impermissibly ap-\n plied the All Writs Act (AWA) and violated his constitu-\n tional right of petition under the First Amendment.\n Because we have jurisdiction only to review legal questions\n appealed from the Veterans Court and because we disagree\n with Mr. Wright\u2019s legal arguments, we affirm.\n                               I\n     Mr. Wright served in the U.S. Navy three times be-\n tween April 1974 and July 1984. S.A. 71. In 2015, he filed\n a claim with VA for multiple disability benefits, including\n a deviated septum (DS), obstructed sleep apnea (OSA), and\n gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). S.A. 74\u201391. VA\n awarded Mr. Wright service connection for DS with a max-\n imum 10 percent rating for that claim, but VA did not reach\n a final decision regarding service connection for his other\n claims of OSA and GERD because the agency was in the\n\n\n\n    1   Citations to Mr. Wright\u2019s informal brief and reply\n (and the pages and documents included therein) reflect the\n pagination applied by this court\u2019s electronic case files sys-\n tem, Docket Nos. 2 and 14, respectively.\n\fCase: 20-1982     Document: 26      Page: 3    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n WRIGHT   v.

S.A. 37\u201338; S.A. 71\u201373.\n     Mr. Wright filed a \u201cpetition for extraordinary individ-\n ual equitable relief\u201d with the Veterans Court, arguing that\n VA had \u201cimplicitly\u201d decided his OSA and GERD claims by\n deciding his DS claim and that VA was unlawfully with-\n holding those benefits. S.A. 11\u201319. The Veterans Court\n construed the petition as a \u201cpetition for extraordinary relief\n in the nature of a writ of mandamus under 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2).\u201d S.A. 20.\n     The Veterans Court denied the petition. Decision at *2.\n The Veterans Court held that it could not issue a writ of\n mandamus under the All Writs Act (AWA) unless Mr.\n Wright could demonstrate, among other things, \u201cthe lack\n of adequate alternative means to obtain the desired relief.\u201d\n Id. at *1 (citing Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 367,\n 380\u201381 (2004)). Finding \u201cMr. Wright\u2019s OSA and GERD\n claims\u201d to be \u201cstill pending with VA,\u201d the Veterans Court\n held that he had \u201calternative means for relief . . . available\n to him.\u201d Id. at *2.\n     Mr. Wright subsequently appealed to this court.\n                               II\n     We have limited jurisdiction over appeals from the Vet-\n erans Court. We decide \u201call relevant questions of law, in-\n cluding interpreting constitutional and statutory\n provisions.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). But except to the extent\n that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, we may not\n review a challenge to a factual determination or a chal-\n lenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a case.\n Id. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); see Wanless v. Shinseki, 618 F.3d 1333,\n 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010). In matters over which we have juris-\n diction, we must set aside any interpretation that is \u201c(A)\n arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional\n right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of\n\fCase: 20-1982     Document: 26       Page: 4   Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                              WRIGHT   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or in viola-\n tion of a statutory right; or (D) without observance of pro-\n cedure required by law.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). We review\n the Veterans Court\u2019s legal determinations under a de novo\n standard. Prenzler v. Derwinski, 928 F.2d 392, 393\n (Fed. Cir. 1991). When a denial of a petition for a writ of\n mandamus raises a \u201cnon-frivolous legal question,\u201d Beasley\n v. Shinseki, 709 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2013), we review\n the denial for abuse of discretion. See Hargrove v. Shinseki,\n 629 F.3d 1377, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Lamb v. Principi, 284\n F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n                               III\n      Two statutes are at issue in this case, 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2) and the AWA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). Mr. Wright\n argues that the Veterans Court should have applied\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2), without invoking the AWA, to compel action\n by the VA Secretary to pay his claims. See Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 1 (\u201c[T]he AWA simply does not apply.\u201d) The applicability of\n the AWA is a legal question over which we have jurisdic-\n tion. Because, as explained below, we read the AWA and\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2) together, we hold that the Veterans Court\u2019s in-\n terpretation of the AWA was proper.\n      The AWA enables federal courts to \u201cissue all writs nec-\n essary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic-\n tions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). Section 7261(a)(2) defines the\n scope of review of the Veterans Court as including \u201ccom-\n pel[ling] action of the Secretary unlawfully withheld or un-\n reasonably delayed.\u201d Together, these provisions give the\n Veterans Court power to issue writs of mandamus when\n the Secretary is unlawfully withholding a veteran\u2019s bene-\n fits.

Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals\n Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985) for the proposition that the\n AWA functions only as a gap-filler and does not apply\n whenever \u201ca statute specifically addresses the particular\n issue at hand.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 1. Mr. Wright contends that\n because \u00a7 7261(a)(2) partially addresses a situation where\n the Secretary is withholding benefits, the AWA cannot ap-\n ply as well. Id. But Pa. Bureau stands for the proposition\n that when another statute specifically limits the reach of a\n court\u2019s power, the AWA does not circumvent that limit. 474\n U.S. at 43. Cases reading the AWA in conjunction with\n \u00a7 7261(a)(2) do not conflict with that principle.\n     Thus, because the Veterans Court followed our and the\n Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in considering the AWA to-\n gether with \u00a7 7261(a)(2), we affirm.\n                              IV\n     Because we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual\n determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as\n applied to the facts of a particular case,\u201d we lack jurisdic-\n tion to consider Mr. Wright\u2019s remaining arguments. 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).\n     Mr. Wright argues that, by \u201crefusing to issue a merits\n decision,\u201d the Veterans Court \u201cimplicitly\u201d held that he does\n \u201cnot have a fundamental right to petition for redress of\n [his] grievances as to the Secretary\u2019s unlawful withholding\n of veteran benefits to which [he is] presently entitled,\u201d pur-\n suant to the \u201cPetition Clause of the First Amendment.\u201d Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Br. 1.\n     Although framed as a constitutional question, this ar-\n gument is really a restatement of the merits of his case be-\n fore the Veterans Court. The Veterans Court applied the\n AWA to the facts of Mr. Wright\u2019s case by denying\n Mr. Wright\u2019s petition because he had adequate alternative\n\fCase: 20-1982    Document: 26      Page: 6    Filed: 12/14/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                            WRIGHT   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n means to obtain his desired relief. Decision at *3.\n Mr. Wright argues that this holding was incorrect because\n the Veterans Court incorrectly determined that he had\n missed medical examinations necessary to his pending VA\n claims. See Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 11\u201316. We have no juris-\n diction over these questions of fact or application of law to\n fact. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Mr. Wright\u2019s argument that he\n has been denied constitutional rights reiterates these\n points. See Appellant\u2019s Br. 1 (arguing that VA\u2019s \u201cunlawful\n withholding\u201d of benefits \u201cimplicitly\u201d violates the constitu-\n tion). Although we have jurisdiction to consider constitu-\n tional questions, appellants must do more than state that\n improper application of law to fact in the Veterans Court\n implicitly violates the constitution. See Helfer v. West, 174\n F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (an appellant\u2019s \u201ccharacter-\n ization of [a] question as constitutional in nature does not\n confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack\u201d). Be-\n cause the Veterans Court decision did not make any deci-\n sion regarding the First Amendment, even implicitly, we\n have no jurisdiction to consider this argument.\n                              V\n     In this appeal, the only issue over which we have juris-\n diction is whether the AWA applies to Mr. Wright\u2019s petition\n for a writ of mandamus. Because we hold that \u00a7 7261(a)(2)\n must be read in conjunction with the AWA under these cir-\n cumstances, we affirm the Veterans Court\u2019s decision that\n it does.\n                        AFFIRMED\n No costs.\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/136997/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/175105/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/557449/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/182329/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/777085/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111538/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/763546/"], "case_name": "Wright v.

In re\n Coles, No. 87570785, 2019 WL 5290188 (T.T.A.B. Sept. 26,\n 2019). Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s\n conclusion, we affirm.\n                       I. BACKGROUND\n     On August 16, 2017, Coles filed an application seeking\n registration on the principal register of \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d\n in standard characters. He identified the services as:\n     Entertainment services, namely, on-line non-\n     downloadable videos, in the field of beer, beer ac-\n     cessories and the beer industry; provision of enter-\n     tainment, namely, on-line non-downloadable\n     videos concerning beer, beer accessories and the\n     beer industry.\n J.A. 223. With his application, Coles included still images\n from a video, entitled \u201c5 Last Minute Gift Ideas That Won\u2019t\n Cut Into Your Beer Fund,\u201d that can be found on his web-\n site. J.A. 37\u201348.\n     Over three non-final office actions and a final office ac-\n tion, the examining attorney refused to register the mark,\n finding that it was merely descriptive of a feature of the\n identified services. See J.A. 51\u201382, 97\u2013180, 201\u201304,\n 226\u201379. In the final office action, issued January 9, 2019,\n the examining attorney distilled the issue. \u201cBrew,\u201d as de-\n fined by Merriam-Webster\u2019s Online Dictionary, means \u201ca\n brewed beverage (such as beer).\u201d J.A. 227 (quoting J.A.\n 232). \u201cScience,\u201d as defined by The American Heritage Dic-\n tionary of the English Language, means \u201c[a] systematic\n method or body of knowledge in a given area.\u201d J.A. 227\n (quoting J.A. 235). In light of these definitions, the exam-\n ining attorney concluded a consumer would understand\n \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d as describing \u201ca body of knowledge\n about beer or preparing beer.\u201d J.A. 228. And the\n\fCase: 20-1236      Document: 33      Page: 3     Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: COLES                                                    3\n\n\n\n examining attorney found that the record, including nu-\n merous online videos and websites, established that \u201ccon-\n sumers who brew and consume beer commonly use the\n wording \u2018BREW SCIENCE\u2019 to describe information about\n beer and preparing beer.\u201d J.A. 228.\n     The examining attorney further found that the descrip-\n tion of Coles\u2019 videos on his website confirmed that the mark\n is merely descriptive of the described services. The website\n explains that it is \u201c[a] beer show\u201d that \u201cdo[es] sciencey type\n stuff like experiments.\u201d Id. And, the website represents,\n \u201c[w]e are committed to ensuring that no beer-related query\n (a buery, if you will) goes un-answered.\u201d Id.\n     Coles appealed to the Board. Coles acknowledged that\n \u201cbrew\u201d is a slang term for beer. Coles focused his argu-\n ment, instead, on a contention that the \u201cvideo services are\n comedic in nature and not scientific.\u201d J.A. 302. Given the\n allegedly comedic nature of Coles\u2019 videos, he claimed that\n the \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d mark is \u201cplayful and fanciful in the\n context of its services.\u201d Id.\n     The examining attorney, in her appeal brief before the\n Board, cited several pieces of evidence to establish that\n \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d is descriptive. She presented diction-\n ary definitions of \u201cbrew\u201d and \u201cscience,\u201d numerous online\n sources using the phrase, and statements on Coles\u2019 website\n describing the videos as relating to \u201csciencey type stuff.\u201d\n     The Board found that the record established the defini-\n tion of \u201cbrew\u201d as a \u201cbrewed beverage (such as beer).\u201d Coles,\n 2019 WL 5290188, at *5. The Board further found that the\n record established the definition of \u201cscience\u201d as \u201ca system-\n atic method or body of knowledge in a given area.\u201d Id. In\n the context of Coles\u2019 services, it concluded, \u201c\u2018science\u2019 . . . de-\n scribes a body of knowledge about beer or brewing beer.\u201d\n Id. The Board also found that the evidence tended to show\n that \u201cbrew science\u201d is used in the beer industry to discuss\n beer knowledge. Id. at *6.\n\fCase: 20-1236     Document: 33     Page: 4    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                                 IN RE: COLES\n\n\n\n\n      The Board therefore held that \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d is \u201ca\n merely descriptive term related to a body of knowledge\n about beer or brewing beer.\u201d Id. at *7. And, when used in\n connection with Coles\u2019 identified entertainment services,\n \u201cit immediately tells consumers about a feature of those\n services, namely, that the entertainment provided in the\n form of non-downloadable videos featuring beer and the\n beer industry includes videos related to the science of beer,\n or BREW SCIENCE.\u201d Id. The Board thus affirmed the\n examining attorney\u2019s refusal to register \u201cBREW\n SCIENCE.\u201d Id. at *8.\n     Coles appeals the Board\u2019s decision. We have jurisdic-\n tion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(B).\n                         II. ANALYSIS\n     The Lanham Act precludes registration of a mark that\n \u201cwhen used on or in connection with the goods of the appli-\n cant is merely descriptive . . . of them.\u201d 15 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1052(e)(1). \u201cA term is merely descriptive if it immedi-\n ately conveys knowledge of a quality, feature, function, or\n characteristic of the goods or services with which it is\n used.\u201d In re Bayer AG, 488 F.3d 960, 963 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n \u201cA mark may be merely descriptive even if it does not de-\n scribe the \u2018full scope and extent\u2019 of the applicant\u2019s goods or\n services.\u201d In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171,\n 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n       The Board\u2019s determination that a mark is merely de-\n scriptive is a factual finding, which we review for substan-\n tial evidence support. In re TriVita, Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874\n (Fed. Cir. 2015). \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018means such rele-\n vant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as ade-\n quate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d In re Bayer AG, 488 F.3d\n at 964 (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197,\n 229 (1938)). Given this deferential standard, \u201cwe may not\n reverse the Board\u2019s decision for lack of substantial evidence\n . . . so long as competent evidence in the record supports\n\fCase: 20-1236     Document: 33     Page: 5    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: COLES                                                5\n\n\n\n the Board\u2019s ruling.\u201d DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro\n Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1252 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n     Coles\u2019 arguments on appeal amount to one overarching\n contention: the Board\u2019s decision lacks substantial evidence\n support. For the reasons discussed below, we disagree.\n     Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that\n \u201cbrew\u201d refers to beer. See Coles, 2019 WL 5290188, at *5.\n The Board cited two dictionaries and multiple definitions.\n Id. at *2. That evidence is substantial evidence supporting\n the Board\u2019s conclusion. The fact that, as Coles contends,\n \u201cbrew\u201d can also refer to, inter alia, the brewing of tea, does\n not detract from the conclusion that brew is a commonly\n accepted term for beer and that, in the context of entertain-\n ment services related to beer, a consumer would reasona-\n bly understand the term to refer to beer.\n     Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s finding\n that \u201cscience\u201d refers generally to \u201ca systematic method or\n body of knowledge in a given area,\u201d and specifically, in the\n context of Coles\u2019 mark, to \u201ca body of knowledge about beer\n or brewing beer.\u201d Id. at *5. The Board supported its con-\n clusion with multiple dictionary definitions. Id. at *2. The\n Board further explained that Coles\u2019 own website, which de-\n scribes his videos as containing \u201csciencey type stuff,\u201d in-\n cluding experimenting with different beer combinations,\n confirmed its understanding. Id. at *5. Given this, the\n Board rejected Coles\u2019 contention that \u201cscience\u201d was used in\n a merely \u201cplayful\u201d manner to describe the videos. Id. On\n appeal, Coles again argues that \u201cscience\u201d is used in a come-\n dic fashion. But, as the Board aptly observed, Coles\u2019 de-\n scribed services are broad enough to encompass \u201cproviding\n non-downloadable videos concerning the science of beer\n and the science of brewing beer.\u201d Id. That his specific prod-\n uct is comedic does not overcome the fact that the specified\n services are not so limited.\n     Finally, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s find-\n ing that the mark \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d is descriptive of\n\fCase: 20-1236     Document: 33     Page: 6    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                                 IN RE: COLES\n\n\n\n\n Coles\u2019 identified services. The Board found that the terms\n \u201cbrew\u201d and \u201cscience,\u201d when combined, retain their descrip-\n tive significance. Id. at *6. The Board cited numerous\n online sources using the term \u201cbrew science.\u201d Id. at *2\u20135.\n It concluded that those sources establish that \u201cbrew sci-\n ence\u201d is \u201cused in the beer industry, by home brewers, by\n educational institutions, by bloggers and on websites in\n discussing beer, including the brewing of beer, and making\n craft brews.\u201d Id. at *6. Coles\u2019 own website, moreover,\n clearly describes his videos as relating to the knowledge of\n beer. The Board, citing this evidence, concluded that\n \u201cBREW SCIENCE\u201d was just as descriptive as its individual\n components. Id. Given the extensive evidence cited by the\n Board, we hold that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by\n substantial evidence.\n      Coles argues that the Patent and Trademark Office has\n previously registered several marks containing the term\n \u201cscience\u201d for entertainment services. He contends that this\n creates precedent that \u201cscience\u201d is not descriptive of enter-\n tainment services. Appellant\u2019s Br. 13\u201314. We disagree. A\n list of marks containing \u201cscience\u201d is, at best, probative and\n does not overcome the substantial evidence cited by the\n Board that establishes the descriptiveness of \u201cBREW\n SCIENCE\u201d in relation to the specific services at issue in\n this case. We note, moreover, that Coles provides us with\n a bare list of marks containing \u201cscience.\u201d Such a list estab-\n lishes nothing of relevance to this case, as there is no basis\n for us to assume that the cited marks are themselves in-\n herently distinctive.\n                         CONCLUSION\n     We have considered Coles\u2019 remaining arguments and\n find them unpersuasive.

DVA\n\n\n\n PER CURIAM.\n      Appellant Jennifer L. Miller was removed from her po-\n sition as a licensed practical nurse (\u201cLPN\u201d) with the De-\n partment of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d) for failing to\n maintain her LPN license. She appealed her removal to\n the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d), which\n upheld her removal. We affirm.\n                                I\n     Between 2014 and 2019, Ms. Miller was employed as\n an LPN at a DVA medical facility. A condition of her em-\n ployment as an LPN was that she maintain her LPN li-\n cense. In 2018, she was given a courtesy notice by the DVA\n that her LPN license was about to expire. She renewed her\n license that year on the day before her license was set to\n expire.\n      In August 2019, shortly before Ms. Miller\u2019s license was\n set to expire, the DVA again gave her a courtesy notice that\n her license was about to expire. This time, Ms. Miller did\n not renew her license, and it expired on September 5, 2019.\n The DVA subsequently proposed to remove her from her\n position because of her failure to maintain her LPN license.\n      At the time her license expired, Ms. Miller was on\n leave-without-pay status. In the notice of proposed re-\n moval, the agency proposed to detail her to a non-LPN po-\n sition if and when she returned to work. The notice stated:\n \u201cYour supervisor will give you a detail assignment when/if\n you return to duty. You will be detailed while the proposed\n removal is in process, i.e., until the proposed removal has\n been decided.\u201d\n     Ms. Miller never returned to work. Through a repre-\n sentative, she made an oral response to the proposed re-\n moval and supported that response with documentation.\n The agency subsequently removed her, effective October\n 22, 2019, for failure to maintain her LPN license. In the\n removal decision, the deciding official sustained the charge\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25    Page: 3    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n MILLER   v. DVA                                            3\n\n\n\n of failure to maintain a current, full, and unrestricted li-\n cense as a licensed practical nurse.\n     Ms. Miller appealed the removal action to the Board.\n She waived her right to a hearing before an administrative\n judge, and the case was decided based on the parties\u2019 writ-\n ten submissions.\n     The administrative judge who was assigned to the case\n upheld the removal action in a comprehensive opinion. The\n administrative judge noted that maintaining LPN licen-\n sure was a condition of Ms. Miller\u2019s employment as an LPN\n and that it was her responsibility to ensure that she re-\n mained licensed throughout her employment with the\n DVA.\n     In her presentation to the administrative judge, Ms.\n Miller contended that because she was on leave at the time\n her license expired, she was not able to access the agency\u2019s\n training resources. The administrative judge found, how-\n ever, that Ms. Miller had complete access to the agency\u2019s\n computer systems and her workplace prior to the time she\n was removed. Moreover, the administrative judge con-\n cluded that even if Ms. Miller did not have access to her\n workplace during the period prior to the expiration of her\n license, the agency could not be held responsible for that\n lack of access because Ms. Miller entered leave status at\n her own request. The administrative judge also found that\n Ms. Miller could have satisfied the requirements for her li-\n cense renewal by accessing training resources from outside\n the agency.\n      Before the administrative judge, Ms. Miller claimed\n that the agency\u2019s decision to remove her was the product of\n discrimination based on a chronic disability. The adminis-\n trative judge rejected that claim, finding that Ms. Miller\n did not establish that her disability was a factor in her re-\n moval. The administrative judge also found that Ms. Mil-\n ler failed to prove that the agency\u2019s decision to remove her\n constituted unlawful reprisal based on (1) an equal-\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25      Page: 4     Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                                   MILLER   v. DVA\n\n\n\n employment-opportunity complaint she filed against the\n agency in 2018, (2) her use of leave under the Family and\n Medical Leave Act, and (3) acts of whistleblowing on her\n part.\n    Ms. Miller petitioned this court for review of the ad-\n ministrative judge\u2019s decision. 1\n                                II\n     At the outset, the government argues that we must dis-\n miss the petition in this case because Ms. Miller has not\n unequivocally abandoned her discrimination claim, and\n thus this is a \u201cmixed case\u201d that is outside the scope of our\n jurisdiction. See Perry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 137 S. Ct.\n 1975, 1977 (2017). We disagree.\n     While Ms. Miller lodged a complaint of discrimination\n against the agency in 2018, that complaint was not related\n to her removal, which occurred a year later. And while she\n asserted before the administrative judge in this case that\n her removal was the product of disability discrimination\n and reprisal for equal employment opportunity activity,\n\n\n\n     1    Ms. Miller argues that the government\u2019s brief was\n untimely filed and that it should be rejected as a result. We\n hold that the government\u2019s brief was timely under the rules\n of this court. Ms. Miller\u2019s brief was filed on June 23, 2020,\n and the certified list of the materials constituting the rec-\n ord was received by the court on June 25, 2020. Pursuant\n to Fed. Cir. R. 31(e)(2), the government\u2019s brief was due for\n filing 21 days after the filing of the certified list, on July 16,\n 2020. The government\u2019s brief was filed on that day. Ap-\n parently, the brief was mailed to Ms. Miller\u2019s prior address.\n See App. 124. On August 17, 2020, the government\u2019s brief\n was served on Ms. Miller at the proper address. The min-\n isterial error in initially serving Ms. Miller at an outdated\n address does not justify rejecting the government\u2019s brief.\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25     Page: 5   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n MILLER   v. DVA                                             5\n\n\n\n she has abandoned those claims on appeal and is pressing\n only issues over which this court has jurisdiction.\n     In her statement pursuant to Fed. Cir. R. 15(c), Ms.\n Miller represented that no claim of discrimination has been\n or will be raised in this case and that any claim of discrim-\n ination raised before and decided by the Board \u201chas been\n abandoned or will not be raised or continued in this or any\n other court.\u201d In addition, in her reply brief Ms. Miller\n stated unequivocally that she is waiving her discrimination\n claims in this action and that her claim pending before the\n Equal Employment Opportunity Commission does not re-\n late to her removal. We regard those statements as suffi-\n cient to constitute an express waiver of any discrimination\n claims relating to her removal action and thus sufficient to\n give this court jurisdiction over her petition for review. See\n Harris v. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n, 972 F.3d 1307, 1317\u201318\n (Fed. Cir. 2020); Diggs v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 670\n F.3d 1353, 1355 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Davidson v. U.S.\n Postal Serv., 24 F.3d 223, 224 (Fed. Cir. 1994).\n                              III\n     On the merits, Ms. Miller has abandoned her claims of\n discrimination and retaliation. Instead, she argues that\n the removal decision was not supported by substantial ev-\n idence and that the administrative judge\u2019s decision was in-\n fected by improper procedure.\n     1. There is no merit to the argument that the removal\n decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. The re-\n moval action was based on a single ground: Ms. Miller\u2019s\n failure to renew her LPN license. There is no dispute that\n maintaining LPN licensure is a condition of her employ-\n ment and that it was her personal responsibility to ensure\n that her license was renewed and not allowed to lapse.\n There is also no dispute that Ms. Miller failed to renew her\n LPN license prior to its expiration and her removal.\n\fCase: 20-1820     Document: 25     Page: 6    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                                MILLER   v. DVA\n\n\n\n      2. Nor is there any force to Ms. Miller\u2019s argument that\n the agency somehow interfered with her ability to renew\n her license. The administrative judge found that Ms. Mil-\n ler\u2019s access to agency computers and other resources was\n uninhibited and that, in any event, she could have used\n outside resources to complete the tasks necessary to effect\n the renewal.\n     3. Ms. Miller\u2019s procedural arguments are equally de-\n void of merit. Her principal focus is on the rebuttal evi-\n dence that the DVA presented to the administrative judge\n during the Board proceedings. Her first objection is that\n the agency\u2019s rebuttal evidence was not before the deci-\n sionmaker at the time the agency made the decision to re-\n move her. For that reason, she argues, the evidence should\n not have been presented to the administrative judge in her\n appeal to the Board.\n     There is no legal requirement that all the evidence an\n agency presents in a Board appeal must have been pre-\n sented to the agency at the time of the agency action that\n is under review. While the Board generally may not uphold\n an adverse agency action on a ground different from the\n charge levied by the agency as the basis for the action, see\n King v. Nazelrod, 43 F.3d 663, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the ev-\n idence that can be presented to the Board in support of that\n charge is not limited to the evidence recited in the agency\u2019s\n notices of proposed and final action, see Licausi v. Office of\n Pers. Mgmt., 350 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Among\n other reasons for introducing additional evidence in Board\n proceedings, it is frequently the case\u2014as it was here\u2014that\n parties raise new issues to the Board, such as affirmative\n defenses, and that those new issues give rise to newly rel-\n evant evidence. 2\n\n\n\n     2  Ms. Miller contends that \u201cthe Board is limited to\n reviewing the grounds invoked by the agency and may not\n\fCase: 20-1820      Document: 25    Page: 7    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n MILLER   v. DVA                                            7\n\n\n\n      The agency\u2019s case-in-chief was straightforward. It\n consisted of proof that Ms. Miller failed to comply with a\n condition of her employment: LPN licensure. As the ad-\n ministrative judge noted, the agency\u2019s rebuttal evidence\n was directed to Ms. Miller\u2019s affirmative defenses and her\n reasons why she should not be faulted for allowing her LPN\n license to lapse.\n     Because the agency\u2019s rebuttal statement consisted of\n evidence responding to Ms. Miller\u2019s affirmative defenses\n and her replies to the charge, the agency\u2019s rebuttal state-\n ment was appropriate rebuttal evidence. Ms. Miller\u2019s rep-\n resentative objected to the introduction of the agency\u2019s\n rebuttal evidence, even though it was provided for in the\n administrative judge\u2019s order canceling the hearing in the\n case. Her representative did not, however, seek leave to\n offer a substantive response to the agency\u2019s rebuttal state-\n ment. We conclude that the procedure employed by the ad-\n ministrative judge with respect to the agency\u2019s rebuttal\n statement was not improper and did not deprive Ms. Miller\n of her rights to due process of law.\n\n\n\n\n \u2018substitute what it considers to be better basis and evidence\n (undisput[ed] new rebuttal evidence in this case) for re-\n moval than what was identified by the agency and Notice.\u2019\u201d\n Reply Br. 8 (quoting O\u2019Keefe v. U.S. Postal Serv., 318 F.3d\n 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). That contention is based on a\n misquotation of O\u2019Keefe. The words \u201cand evidence\u201d and the\n ensuing parenthetical do not appear in the quoted passage\n from O\u2019Keefe. Hence, that case does not stand for the prop-\n osition that an agency\u2019s presentation of evidence in Board\n proceedings is limited to evidence previously set forth in a\n notice of proposed removal. Instead, O\u2019Keefe stands for the\n quite different proposition that the Board may not affirm a\n removal action on the basis of charges not set out in the\n notice of proposed removal.\n\fCase: 20-1820    Document: 25      Page: 8    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n8                                               MILLER   v. DVA\n\n\n\n      4. Finally, Ms. Miller complains that the agency ad-\n vised her that it would detail her to a non-patient-care po-\n sition pending the removal proceedings when she returned\n to duty, but that no such detail was ever arranged. Ms.\n Miller, however, did not return to work after the issuance\n of the notice of proposed removal. Accordingly, by its\n terms, the proposal to assign her to a detail never came into\n effect. Because Ms. Miller did not take the step that would\n have triggered her assignment to a detail during the re-\n moval proceedings, the agency did not act improperly by\n not assigning her to a detail for that limited period.\n      In sum, Ms. Miller has not overcome the single dispos-\n itive fact in this case: She was required to maintain her\n LPN license as a condition of her employment, and she\n failed to do so. Because substantial evidence supports the\n administrative judge\u2019s ruling on that factual issue and be-\n cause Ms. Miller has failed to point to any other infirmities\n in the proceedings before the agency or the Board, we sus-\n tain the Board\u2019s ruling upholding her removal.\n                        AFFIRMED\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/616443/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/669852/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/784346/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/780795/"], "case_name": "Miller v.

SKYLINE USA, INC.\n\n\n\n    DYK, Circuit Judge.\n     Plaintiff Super-Sparkly Safety Stuff, LLC (\u201cSuper-\n Sparkly\u201d) appeals a decision of the United States District\n Court for the Northern District of Texas. The district court\n entered summary judgment in favor of Defendant Skyline\n USA, Inc. (\u201cSkyline\u201d), concluding that Skyline had not in-\n fringed Super-Sparkly\u2019s design patent. We affirm.\n                          BACKGROUND\n     Super-Sparkly owns a design patent for bedazzled pep-\n per spray canisters, U.S. Patent No. D731,172 (\u201cthe \u2019172\n patent\u201d). This patent claims a design for a pepper spray\n canister decorated with rhinestones, in which rhinestones\n cover the bottom and some portion of the vertical part of a\n pepper spray canister.\n     Skyline sells a line of \u201cBling It On\u201d pepper spray canis-\n ters that are decorated with rhinestones. Unlike the de-\n signs claimed in the \u2019172 patent, the bottom surface of\n Skyline\u2019s canisters is not decorated with rhinestones.\n     In February 2017, Super-Sparkly sent Skyline a cease-\n and-desist letter in which it accused Skyline\u2019s pepper spray\n canisters of infringing its design patent. Skyline re-\n sponded in April 2017, explaining that the accused product\n did not infringe Super-Sparkly\u2019s design patent because the\n bottom of the canister was not decorated with rhinestones.\n      Super-Sparkly filed suit against Skyline in the United\n States District Court for the Northern District of Texas on\n March 13, 2018, alleging direct and induced infringement\n of the \u2019172 patent. 1 Super-Sparkly subsequently contacted\n\n\n       1 Super-Sparkly also owns U.S. Patent No. D696,857\n (\u201cthe \u2019857 patent\u201d), which is similar to the \u2019172 patent.\n While Super-Sparkly\u2019s complaint referred in passing to the\n \u2019857 patent, the substance of the complaint involves only\n the \u2019172 patent, and the district court found that Super-\n\fCase: 20-1490    Document: 47      Page: 3    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v. SKYLINE USA, INC.          3\n\n\n\n Amazon.com, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation, which\n resold the accused product, alleging that Skyline\u2019s product\n infringed Super-Sparkly\u2019s design patents. As a result, Am-\n azon and Dollar General stopped purchasing the accused\n product from Skyline. Thereafter, in the infringement suit,\n Skyline asserted counterclaims against Super-Sparkly, al-\n leging unfair competition under the Lanham Act, common\n law unfair competition, tortious interference with contrac-\n tual relations, tortious interference with business rela-\n tions, tortious interference with prospective contracts, and\n business disparagement.\n      On August 6, 2019, Skyline filed a motion for partial\n summary judgment of noninfringement. On August 21,\n 2019, Super-Sparkly filed a motion for an extension of time\n to respond to the motion for partial summary judgment on\n the grounds that discovery was not yet complete. Then, on\n August 27, 2019, instead of opposing Skyline\u2019s motion for\n partial summary judgment on the merits, Super-Sparkly\n filed a response pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\n dure 56(d), claiming a lack of sufficient facts to file a re-\n sponse. The district court denied Super-Sparkly\u2019s motion\n for an extension of time and granted summary judgment of\n noninfringement. The district court also certified its entry\n of partial summary judgment as final under Federal Rule\n of Civil Procedure 54(b). Super-Sparkly appeals.\n                           DISCUSSION\n     This appeal requires us to resolve two issues: first,\n whether summary judgment was properly certified as fi-\n nal, thereby conferring jurisdiction on the court; and sec-\n ond, whether summary judgment of noninfringement was\n warranted.\n\n\n\n Sparkly alleged infringement of only the \u2019172 patent. On\n appeal, despite again making passing reference to the \u2019857\n patent, Super-Sparkly does not dispute this determination.\n\fCase: 20-1490     Document: 47        Page: 4   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4            SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF     v. SKYLINE USA, INC.\n\n\n\n                                  I\n      When a district court certifies a decision as final under\n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), we must review the\n finality of the judgment de novo to ensure we have jurisdic-\n tion, even if the parties agree that jurisdiction is proper.\n Ultra-Precision Mfg. v. Ford Motor Co., 338 F.3d 1353,\n 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing W.L. Gore & Assocs. v. Int\u2019l\n Med. Prosthetics Rsch. Assocs., Inc., 975 F.2d 858, 862 (Fed.\n Cir. 1992)). For Rule 54(b) to apply, three prerequisites\n must be met: \u201c(1) multiple claims for relief or multiple par-\n ties must be involved; (2) at least one claim or the rights\n and liabilities of at least one party must be finally decided;\n and (3) the district court must find that there is no just rea-\n son for delaying an appeal.\u201d Alfred E. Mann Found. for Sci.\n Rsch. v. Cochlear Corp., 841 F.3d 1334, 1347 (Fed. Cir.\n 2016) (citing 10 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Prac-\n tice and Procedure \u00a7 2656 (3d ed. 2016)). While we review\n finality de novo, we review the district court\u2019s determina-\n tion that there is no just reason for delay for abuse of dis-\n cretion. W.L. Gore, 975 F.2d at 862.\n      Here, all three prerequisites are met. First, the case\n involves multiple claims, as Skyline\u2019s counterclaims are\n still pending before the district court. Second, Super-\n Sparkly\u2019s two patent infringement claims were finally de-\n cided by the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment of\n noninfringement. Third, the district court did not abuse its\n discretion in determining that there is no just reason for\n delay.\n     As the three prerequisites to Rule 54(b) are met, we\n find that the case was properly certified and that we have\n jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\n                                 II\n     Super-Sparkly argues that summary judgment was im-\n proper (1) on the merits because there was a genuine issue\n of material fact as to infringement, and (2) under Federal\n\fCase: 20-1490     Document: 47       Page: 5   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v. SKYLINE USA, INC.           5\n\n\n\n Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), in light of Super-Sparkly\u2019s\n asserted need for additional discovery to respond to the\n summary judgment motion.\n                                 A\n      Design patent infringement occurs when a party,\n \u201cwithout license of the owner, (1) applies the patented de-\n sign, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of\n manufacture for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes\n for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or\n colorable imitation has been applied.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 289. The\n \u201cordinary observer\u201d test is used to determine whether a de-\n sign patent has been infringed. Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v.\n Swisa, Inc., 543 F.3d 665, 678 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc).\n The test inquires whether an accused design appears \u201csub-\n stantially the same\u201d as a patented design, such that \u201can\n ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser\n usually gives,\u201d would be induced \u201cto purchase one suppos-\n ing it to be the other.\u201d Id. at 670 (quoting Gorham Co. v.\n White, 81 U.S. 511, 528 (1871)).\n     We review summary judgment of noninfringement de\n novo. Accent Packaging, Inc. v. Leggett & Platt, Inc., 707\n F.3d 1318, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Laryngeal Mask Co.\n v. Ambu A/S, 618 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2010)).\n     Super-Sparkly and Skyline agree that the difference\n between the \u2019172 patent and the accused design is that the\n former includes rhinestones on the bottom of the pepper\n spray canister, whereas the latter does not. The district\n court did not err in concluding that that this difference pre-\n cludes a finding of infringement under the ordinary ob-\n server test.\n     Under the ordinary observer test, the claimed and ac-\n cused designs may be \u201csufficiently distinct\u201d and \u201cplainly\n dissimilar,\u201d such that an ordinary observer clearly would\n not find the two designs \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1490      Document: 47     Page: 6   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6             SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v. SKYLINE USA, INC.\n\n\n\n Egyptian Goddess, 543 F.3d at 678. When the designs are\n not \u201cplainly dissimilar,\u201d the analysis\n       will benefit from a comparison of the claimed and\n       accused designs with the prior art . . . . Where\n       there are many examples of similar prior art de-\n       signs . . . differences between the claimed and ac-\n       cused designs that might not be noticeable in the\n       abstract can become significant to the hypothetical\n       ordinary observer who is conversant with the prior\n       art.\n Id.\n     The \u2019172 patent claims a very simple design, in which\n rhinestones are applied to two surfaces of a canister: the\n vertical cylinder and the bottom. Removing the rhine-\n stones from one of these surfaces\u2014the bottom\u2014is a signif-\n icant departure from the claimed design. The \u2019172 patent\n and the accused design are thus plainly dissimilar; because\n the accused design lacks rhinestones on one of the two sur-\n faces decorated in the claimed design, an ordinary observer\n would not find the two designs substantially the same.\n      Even assuming that the two designs are not \u201cplainly\n dissimilar,\u201d a comparison with the prior art makes clear\n that the accused design does not infringe the \u2019172 patent.\n Although there do not appear to be \u201cmany examples of sim-\n ilar prior art designs,\u201d the prior art \u201cPepperface\u201d reference,\n dating from 2006, was widely marketed and endorsed by\n various celebrities. 2 Its design has rhinestones around the\n majority of the canister, but not on the top (near the spray\n nozzle) or bottom of the cylinder. Per Egyptian Goddess,\n then, the Pepperface design highlights that the key differ-\n ence between the \u2019172 patent and the accused design is that\n the bottom of the cylinder is decorated with rhinestones.\n\n\n       2A screenshot of the archived Pepperface website is\n included as an attachment to this opinion.\n\fCase: 20-1490     Document: 47       Page: 7   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF    v. SKYLINE USA, INC.           7\n\n\n\n As such, the attention of a hypothetical ordinary observer\n conversant with bedazzled pepper spray canisters would be\n drawn to the presence or absence of rhinestones on the bot-\n tom of the cylinder. See Egyptian Goddess, 543 F.3d at 676.\n     The hypothetical ordinary observer would therefore\n find significant the lack of rhinestones on the bottom of the\n accused design and would not confuse the accused design\n with the \u2019172 patent. The district court correctly concluded\n that the ordinary observer test necessitates a finding of\n noninfringement.\n                                 B\n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) provides that\n where, on a motion for summary judgment, \u201ca nonmovant\n shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons,\n it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition,\u201d\n the district court may defer consideration of the motion or\n deny it; allow time to pursue affidavits, declarations, or dis-\n covery; or \u201cissue any other appropriate order.\u201d Fed. R. Civ.\n P. 56(d).\n     We apply the law of the regional circuit in interpreting\n and applying Rule 56(d). Accent Packaging, 707 F.3d at\n 1325. \u201cThe Fifth Circuit,\u201d where this case arose, \u201creviews\n the district court\u2019s dispositions of Rule 56(d) motions for an\n abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. (citing Raby v. Livingston, 600\n F.3d 552, 561 (5th Cir. 2010)). In the Fifth Circuit, Rule\n 56(d) motions \u201care \u2018broadly favored and should be liberally\n granted\u2019 because the rule is designed to \u2018safeguard non-\n moving parties from summary judgment motions that they\n cannot adequately oppose.\u2019\u201d Raby, 600 F.3d at 561 (quoting\n Culwell v. City of Fort Worth, 468 F.3d 868, 871 (5th Cir.\n 1999)). However, a request under Rule 56(d) must explain\n how \u201cspecified facts . . . if adduced, will influence the out-\n come of the pending summary judgment motion.\u201d Id. (quot-\n ing C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt. Inc., 137 F.3d 41,\n 44 (1st Cir. 1998)). \u201cIf it appears that further discovery will\n not provide evidence creating a genuine issue of material\n\fCase: 20-1490    Document: 47      Page: 8    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n8            SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v.

Corp., 197\n F.3d 694, 720 (5th Cir. 1999)).\n      In his supporting declaration, counsel for Super-\n Sparkly listed fifteen facts without which Super-Sparkly\n was purportedly unable to file a response to Skyline\u2019s mo-\n tion. Super-Sparkly sought information relating to Sky-\n line\u2019s knowledge and opinion of the \u2019172 patent and the\n accused design; the creation and sale of the accused prod-\n uct; and Skyline\u2019s discovery conduct. None of this infor-\n mation, however, has any bearing on the ordinary observer\n test for design patent infringement. Because the infor-\n mation for which Super-Sparkly sought further discovery\n was irrelevant to the issue of infringement, Super-Sparkly\n failed to explain how the specified facts could influence the\n outcome of the motion. The district court did not abuse its\n discretion by denying Super-Sparkly\u2019s request under\n Rule 56(d) and entering summary judgment of nonin-\n fringement.\n                        AFFIRMED\n\fCase: 20-1490   Document: 47       Page: 9    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n SUPER-SPARKLY SAFETY STUFF   v.

Thomas filed a petition for a writ of manda-\n mus with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veter-\n ans Court). Arguing that the Department of Veterans\n Affairs (VA) was being dilatory in deciding various claims\n for benefits he had filed, Mr. Thomas asked for an order\n directing the relevant VA authorities to issue decisions on\n the matters that were before them. The Veterans Court\n denied the petition, concluding that, at least by the time of\n the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, each matter at issue had in\n fact been decided by the VA authority before which it had\n been pending\u2014thus mooting the mandamus request for re-\n lief. See Thomas v. Wilkie, No. 19-2017, 2019 WL 6121120\n (Vet. App. Nov. 19, 2019). Mr. Thomas appeals. Because\n Mr. Thomas has raised no question that is within our lim-\n ited jurisdiction, we dismiss his appeal.\n                               I\n     Mr. Thomas served two tours of active duty with the\n United States Marine Corps\u2014from April 1979 to April\n 1982 and from June 1982 to June 1984. Starting in 2001,\n he filed various claims for benefits with VA, which granted\n some of the requested benefits.\n     On June 28, 2001, Mr. Thomas filed a claim for benefits\n related to bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. On\n September 26, 2005, and again on June 9, 2007, the rele-\n vant VA regional office denied the claim, and Mr. Thomas\n appealed to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. While the ap-\n peal was pending, the regional office on July 3, 2008,\n granted Mr. Thomas benefits for bilateral hearing loss\n (20% disabled) and for tinnitus (10% disabled), with an ef-\n fective date of November 19, 2004, but it did not change its\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30     Page: 3    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n THOMAS V. WILKIE                                          3\n\n\n\n ruling about vertigo. On May 26, 2010, the Board denied\n the appeal still before it.\n      Well before that denial, Mr. Thomas filed, on July 18,\n 2008, a separate claim for benefits related to, among oth-\n ers, depression and Meniere\u2019s disease, a disorder of the in-\n ner ear similar to vertigo affecting balance and hearing.\n Ultimately, on March 17, 2014, the Board granted Mr.\n Thomas\u2019s claim for benefits relating to Meniere\u2019s disease\n and vertigo, to which the regional office, on May 10, 2014,\n assigned a 30% disability rating, with an effective date of\n November 19, 2004, the same as for the benefits based on\n bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. In 2017, the regional\n office granted Mr. Thomas an earlier effective date\u2014June\n 28, 2001, the date of his original informal claim\u2014for each\n of his claims, based on bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus,\n Meniere\u2019s disease, and vertigo.\n      On January 18, 2018, the Board remanded Mr.\n Thomas\u2019s claim based on Meniere\u2019s disease to the regional\n office for that office to determine whether Mr. Thomas was\n entitled to a higher disability rating (than the 30% rating\n already awarded) under a diagnostic code that considered\n Meniere\u2019s disease coupled with cerebellar gait (a stagger-\n ing, uncoordinated or wide-based gait indicative of cerebral\n lesions). The Board explained that it \u201cregret[ted] the addi-\n tional delay\u201d occasioned by the need for additional exami-\n nation of any symptoms of cerebellar gait, and it requested\n expedited handling of Mr. Thomas\u2019s case under 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 20.900(c) (2003).\n     Mr. Thomas received a supplemental examination two\n months later, on March 20, 2018 (the March 2018 exam).\n The regional office issued a supplemental rating decision\n on September 12, 2018, finding that Mr. Thomas was enti-\n tled to an increased 100% rating for Meniere\u2019s disease un-\n der the new diagnostic code, with an effective date of the\n March 2018 exam, when it was documented that his condi-\n tions met the requirements of the diagnostic code. Mr.\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30     Page: 4    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                           THOMAS V. WILKIE\n\n\n\n Thomas returned to the Board, contending that he was en-\n titled to an earlier effective date for his 100% rating, but\n the Board rejected that contention on November 2, 2018.\n Mr. Thomas\u2019s appeal of that Board decision resulted in a\n joint motion for partial remand. Thomas, 2019 WL\n 6121120, at *1 n.1.\n     On February 26, 2019, the original regional office found\n clear and unmistakable error in having separately consid-\n ered bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, on one hand, and\n Meniere\u2019s disease, on the other. It therefore discontinued\n the separate consideration, leaving Mr. Thomas with a\n 100% disability rating effective March 18, 2018. The Sec-\n retary has asserted that Mr. Thomas did not appeal that\n decision to the Board, and Mr. Thomas appears to dispute\n that assertion.\n     Mr. Thomas did not seek only disability benefits. He\n separately filed a claim for benefits for special home adap-\n tation and specially adapted housing in August 2018. The\n regional office denied the claim on October 31, 2018. Mr.\n Thomas filed a Notice of Disagreement on November 15,\n 2018. On January 15, 2019, VA assigned Mr. Thomas\u2019s No-\n tice of Disagreement to a new regional office to issue a\n Statement of the Case, which is the next step in the process\n for appealing to the Board.\n     On March 21, 2019, just two months after the transfer\n of his case, Mr. Thomas filed with the Veterans Court the\n mandamus petition that gave rise to the present appeal. 1\n\n\n\n    1     Mr. Thomas filed at least three other, nearly iden-\n tical petitions for writs of mandamus within a one-year pe-\n riod. See Thomas v. Wilkie, No. 20-4445, 2020 WL 4355638\n (Vet. App. July 30, 2020); Thomas v. Wilkie, No. 19-6414,\n 2019 WL 6461825 (Vet.

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n Crediting the Secretary\u2019s representations, the Veterans\n Court explained that it was \u201csatisfied that [Mr. Thomas\u2019s]\n claims are being adjudicated at the Agency level, the relief\n sought has been granted and his petition . . . is moot\u201d and\n dismissed Mr. Thomas\u2019s petition on November 19, 2019.\n Id.\n     Mr. Thomas timely appealed.\n                               II\n     Our jurisdiction in appeals from the Veterans Court\n under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292 is limited. One limit is the consti-\n tutional rule that we may not decide a case that does not\n involve a live dispute. North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244,\n 246 (1971) (\u201cMootness is a jurisdictional question because\n the Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or ab-\n stract propositions.\u201d (citations and internal quotation\n marks omitted)). Other limits are statutory. See Wanless\n v. Shinseki, 618 F.3d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Except\n where a constitutional claim is raised, we \u201cmay not review\n (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a chal-\n lenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a par-\n ticular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). This court does have\n jurisdiction to \u201cdecide all relevant questions of law, includ-\n ing interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions.\u201d\n Id. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). Those limits apply to an appeal under\n \u00a7 7292 of a Veterans Court decision on a petition for a writ\n of mandamus; in particular, we may not review a Veterans\n Court decision whether to grant a mandamus petition as-\n serting a statutory claim unless a \u201cnon-frivolous legal\n\fCase: 20-1324     Document: 30      Page: 6    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                             THOMAS V.

Cir. 2020) (applying both\n mootness and legal-question principles to dismiss appeal).\n     In this case, Mr. Thomas\u2019s petition for a writ of manda-\n mus, fairly construed, was a request that the VA act on his\n claims in a timely fashion. The Veterans Court concluded\n that there was no live dispute before it because Mr.\n Thomas\u2019s mandamus petition sought relief in the form of a\n directive to the VA to act on his claims and \u201cthe relief\n sought has been granted.\u201d Thomas, 2019 WL 6121120, at\n *1. That ruling, made in the mandamus context, invokes\n the general principle that an appeal should \u201cbe dismissed\n as moot when . . . a court of appeals cannot grant \u2018any ef-\n fectual relief whatever\u2019 in favor of the appellant.\u201d Calderon\n v. Moore, 518 U.S. 149, 150 (1996) (per curiam) (quoting\n Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895)); see also, e.g., Mote\n v. Wilkie, 976 F.3d 1337, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Ebanks v.\n Shulkin, 877 F.3d 1037, 1039\u201340 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Monk v.\n Shulkin, 855 F.3d 1312, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n     We need not and do not decide whether the characteri-\n zation of the dispute as \u201cmoot\u201d is correct. According to the\n Veterans Court\u2019s description, this case does not involve the\n usual pattern of mootness\u2014in which a case that was live\n when filed is no longer a live one because of a post-filing\n change in relevant circumstances. Here, what the Veter-\n ans Court determined Mr. Thomas was seeking but already\n had received (i.e., VA action on his claims) was something\n he already had received even before the mandamus peti-\n tion was filed. 2 Moreover, although the mandamus\n\n\n     2   This is not a case of VA action taken after the filing\n of a mandamus petition to moot an issue of unreasonable\n delay raised in that petition. See Monk, 855 F.3d at 1321\n (discussing that situation). Nor is there a showing here of\n the applicability of mootness exceptions for \u201cvoluntary\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30     Page: 7    Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n THOMAS V. WILKIE                                          7\n\n\n\n petition is hardly clear, it is possible that the mandamus\n petition was effectively seeking even faster VA action than\n he already had received or would receive without judicial\n intervention. For those reasons, whether dismissal for\n \u201cmootness\u201d was correct raises some questions.\n     But we need not address those questions\u2014or the re-\n lated question whether the dispute is a live one in this\n court. Mr. Thomas has identified no concrete difference be-\n tween a dismissal and a denial of the mandamus petition\n in this case; he would be in exactly the same position re-\n gardless. And under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, we lack statutory\n jurisdiction over his challenge to the Veterans Court ruling\n viewed as a denial, because he has raised no \u201cnon-frivolous\n legal question\u201d about that ruling so viewed. Beasley, 709\n F.3d at 1158.\n     In his mandamus petition, Mr. Thomas presented a\n statutory challenge, seeking to compel the VA to take ac-\n tion that had been withheld for an unreasonably long time.\n But he has presented no non-frivolous argument that the\n Veterans Court committed a legal error regarding such un-\n reasonable delay under the standards of Telecommunica-\n tions Research & Action Center v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 76\n (D.C. Cir. 1984) (TRAC), adopted by this court in Martin v.\n O\u2019Rourke, 891 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2018), for unreasonable-\n delay challenges. More precisely and narrowly, to secure\n the \u201cextraordinary\u201d relief of mandamus, Mr. Thomas had\n to show, at a minimum, that he had \u201ca clear legal right to\n relief\u201d under the TRAC standards. Beasley, 709 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n cessation of challenged conduct,\u201d Adarand Constructors,\n Inc. v. Slater, 528 U.S. 216, 222 (2000) (per curiam), or\n challenged conduct that is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evad-\n ing review,\u201d Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, 136\n S.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n 1157. Mr. Thomas has no non-frivolous basis for asserting\n a legal error under that even more demanding standard.\n     Mr. Thomas cannot point to any ruling by the Veterans\n Court in this matter that contains a legal error regarding\n the unreasonable-delay issue. The Veterans Court did not\n address the merits of that issue. Nor has Mr. Thomas\n pointed to any basis on which we could find that a correct\n view of the law\u2014under TRAC as applied in the mandamus\n setting\u2014could have supported mandamus relief in this\n case. As to the disability claims based on Meniere\u2019s dis-\n ease, vertigo, tinnitus, and bilateral hearing loss, Mr.\n Thomas received a decision from the regional office on Feb-\n ruary 26, 2019, and by March 21, 2019, when he filed his\n mandamus petition, there could have been no argument for\n unreasonable withholding of some further VA action. 3 As\n to Mr. Thomas\u2019s claims regarding specially adapted hous-\n ing, Mr. Thomas filed his mandamus petition just four\n months after filing his Notice of Disagreement with the Oc-\n tober 2018 denial, and the VA was in the midst of prepar-\n ing the Statement of the Case that is the essential next step\n in proceeding to the Board for review of the denial. There\n is no non-frivolous basis for an argument of a clear legal\n right to faster processing. In these circumstances, we see\n no non-frivolous legal question regarding unreasonable de-\n lay that would give us jurisdiction under \u00a7 7292 to review\n the mandamus decision of the Veterans Court.\n     In this court, Mr. Thomas devotes much of his appeal\n to the merits of his claims, specifically seeking an earlier\n effective date for benefits, citing evidence that he alleges\n the Board ignored. Thomas Op. Br. 10\u201312. But none of\n those arguments identifies a legal issue that was presented\n to the Veterans Court, let alone resolved by that court.\n\n\n     3  The parties appear to dispute whether Mr. Thomas\n missed his opportunity for further review of that decision.\n We need not resolve that dispute.\n\fCase: 20-1324    Document: 30      Page: 9   Filed: 12/11/2020\n\n\n\n\n THOMAS V. WILKIE                                          9\n\n\n\n Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to decide factual issues or\n the application of legal standards to the particular facts,\n unless there is a constitutional claim.          38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Here, there is no constitutional claim. Alt-\n hough Mr. Thomas states that he was denied due process,\n he provides no basis for that assertion apart from his mer-\n its challenges to the VA\u2019s particular determinations on his\n claims, so his due-process challenge is constitutional in\n name only and is not reviewable.

See Nken\n v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).\n     Based on the papers submitted, we conclude that the\n appellants have not established that a stay of the final\n judgment pending appeal is warranted here. 1\n\n\n     1   The dissent and the government believe that CIT\n Rules 62(d) and (e), read together, require an automatic\n stay because the judgment here functions as a monetary\n judgment. We disagree. The CIT considered and rejected\n the argument that the two rules trigger an automatic stay\n pending appeal when the government is the appellant; the\n government remains unable to cite precedent to the con-\n trary, at least as to the CIT\u2019s rules specifically. See Appel-\n lees\u2019 Resp. at 8. To be sure, the dissent cites non-binding\n precedent interpreting the materially similar Federal\n Rules of Civil Procedure in this way.

The United\n States appealed.\n      On August 13, 2020, the United States filed with the\n Trade Court, under U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT)\n Rule 62, a motion to stay the judgment\u2014whose only non-\n declaratory portion is an order to refund an amount that\n plaintiffs do not dispute is a matter of easy, objective cal-\n culation. About a month later, the Trade Court denied the\n motion. Stay Opinion, 2020 WL 5530091, at *3. The court\n first rejected the government\u2019s contention that, because the\n refund order is purely monetary in character and easily cal-\n culable in amount, the government is entitled to an auto-\n matic stay pending appeal without posting a bond or other\n security. Id. The Trade Court also rejected the govern-\n ment\u2019s argument for a stay under the four-part standard\n that considers the merits, the potential for irreparable in-\n jury to the stay applicant, the other parties\u2019 interests, and\n the public interest\u2014though the Trade Court enjoined liq-\n uidation of the subject steel entries pending appeal. Id. at\n *2\u20134 (applying standard from Hilton v. Braunskill, 481\n U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).\n    The United States now seeks a stay from this court.

That proposition, ar-\n rived at in two steps, is supported by ample precedent ap-\n plying language, notably from Federal Rule of Civil\n Procedure 62, materially the same as the language of CIT\n Rule 62. I would apply this proposition in exercising our\n stay authority under Federal Circuit Rule 8.\n     The first step is the automatic-stay principle that ap-\n plies to appellants generally. CIT Rule 62(d) states: \u201cWhen\n an appeal is taken, the appellant, by giving a supersedeas\n bond, may obtain a stay subject to the exception contained\n in subdivision (a) of this rule.\u201d 1 The only condition is the\n giving of a supersedeas bond, which must be \u201capproved by\n the court.\u201d CIT Rule 62(d) (\u201cThe stay is effective when the\n supersedeas bond is approved by the court.\u201d). These provi-\n sions mirror Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(d) as it stood before 2018, in\n which year its language was moved, with slight modifica-\n tions, to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(b). 2\n\n\n     1   The referred-to \u201cexception\u201d is the exception for \u201cin-\n junction[s]\u201d stated in CIT Rule 62(a): \u201cUnless otherwise or-\n dered by the court, an interlocutory or final judgment in an\n action for an injunction shall not be stayed during the pe-\n riod after its entry and until an appeal is taken or during\n the pendency of any appeal.\u201d\n     2    Fed.

Congress has provided: \u201cSecurity for damages or\n costs shall not be required of the United States, any depart-\n ment or agency thereof or any party acting under the direc-\n tion of any such department or agency on the issuance of\n process or the institution or prosecution of any proceeding.\u201d\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2408. That principle is reflected in CIT Rule\n 62(e), which immediately follows the automatic-stay provi-\n sion of Rule 62(d). CIT Rule 62(e) states: \u201cWhen an appeal\n\fCase: 20-2157    Document: 32      Page: 10    Filed: 12/10/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                              TRANSPACIFIC STEEL LLC   v. US\n\n\n\n is taken by the United States or an officer or agency thereof\n or by direction of any department of the Government of the\n United States and the operation or enforcement of the judg-\n ment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall\n be required from the appellant.\u201d That language matches\n the language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(e) as it stood in 2006.\n The current language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(e)\u2014adopted in\n 2007 as part of the Rules-wide language changes that, ac-\n cording to the 2007 Advisory Committee Notes, were \u201cin-\n tended to be stylistic only\u201d\u2014reads: \u201cThe court must not\n require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appel-\n lant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United\n States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed\n by a department of the federal government.\u201d\n     The no-required-security language of CIT Rule 62(e),\n and of its pre-2007 Federal Rules counterpart, is readily\n understood, as a textual matter, to bear a simple relation-\n ship to the automatic-stay language of the preceding sub-\n section on automatic stays.         The bond required of\n appellants generally, as the sole condition of obtaining the\n stay as of right, must not be required of the federal govern-\n ment to obtain that automatic stay\u2014which is available to\n the federal government as of right for monetary judgments\n without a bond. That straightforward relationship be-\n tween Rule 62(d) and 62(e) reflects the recognized lack of\n need for security against the government. Rule 62(e) can-\n not sensibly be read as depriving the federal government,\n alone among all appellants facing monetary judgments, of\n the entitlement to an automatic stay of a monetary judg-\n ment without further inquiry into the merits and equities\n unless it posts security that the Rule and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804\n forbid the court to require. This understanding of the lan-\n guage of CIT Rule 62(e), and of the identical pre-2007 Fed.\n R. Civ. P. 62(e), is reinforced by the current language of\n Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(e), which is even clearer in its implica-\n tion. The new language was included among the revisions\n that the Rules revisers said made no substantive change of\n\fCase: 20-2157    Document: 32     Page: 11   Filed: 12/10/2020\n\n\n\n\n TRANSPACIFIC STEEL LLC   v.

That conclu-\n sion appears to have been reached, in various contexts, by\n the several circuit courts that have addressed the matter. 3\n And the same conclusion has been reached by numerous\n district courts. 4 See Wright & Miller \u00a7 2905.

US\n\n\n\n a stay pending appeal without bond anyway, though sub-\n ject to certain conditions, under the usual four-part stay\n analysis. Id. at 167\u201368. 5\n     I think that the above considerations suffice to support\n the conclusion that, in a Trade Court case, if the relevant\n part of the judgment at issue is monetary, the United\n States is entitled to a stay pending appeal without posting\n a supersedeas bond or other security and without consider-\n ation of the merits or equities. That conclusion is well-\n grounded in the text of CIT Rule 62, for the reasons indi-\n cated. It is also supported in a substantial, highly lopsided\n body of judicial decisions going back many years under the\n Federal Rules counterpart to the CIT Rule. Plaintiffs\n themselves have not contested this legal proposition.\n                              B\n      Plaintiffs dispute only the application of the proposi-\n tion to this case. In doing so, they do not dispute that the\n amount ordered to be paid\u2014the difference between the tar-\n iffs they paid and a 25% tariff (plus costs and interest)\u2014is\n easily and objectively calculated. Their argument, instead,\n is simply that the portion of the judgment ordering the\n United States to refund plaintiffs that difference (plus\n costs and interests) is not a monetary judgment subject to\n the automatic-stay principle. I disagree. When a judgment\n contains a provision requiring payment of money, in an\n\n\n\n      5  The Bankruptcy Court relied on two district court\n decisions, neither of which ruled on the merits of a govern-\n ment request for an automatic stay of a monetary judgment\n without posting a bond.

Life & Annuity Ins. Co.\n v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 216 (2002); see also Bowen v.\n Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 915\u201316 (1988) (Scalia, J., dis-\n senting) (\u201c[T]he line between damages and specific relief\n must surely be drawn on the basis of the substance of the\n claim, and not its mere form.\u201d). Our court and other circuit\n courts have similarly focused on a judgment\u2019s substance ra-\n ther than its form when determining whether the judg-\n ment is monetary. See, e.g., ActiveVideo Networks, 2012\n WL 10716768, at *1 (\u201cThe form of the order to pay money\n does not matter; what matters is \u2018whether the judgment\n involved is monetary or nonmonetary.\u2019\u201d (quoting Hebert,\n 953 F.2d at 938)); see also Titan Tire Corp. of Bryan v.\n United Steel Workers of America, Local 890L, No. 09-4460,\n 2010 WL 815557, at *1 (6th Cir.

Here, the\n district court\u2019s judgment binds Titan to pay a specific sum\n of money, i.e., back wages.\u201d). The refund order here in sub-\n stance compels the United States to transfer money after\n performing a straightforward calculation to determine the\n amount. 6\n\n\n\n     6   Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint reinforces the un-\n derstanding of the judgment as monetary in the relevant\n sense.

Plaintiffs\u2019 Opp. to Stay Motion at 8.\n But even aside from the fact that those decisions are not\n binding precedent for us, neither decision justifies a con-\n clusion that the refund order here is outside the automatic-\n stay principle.\n     Plaintiffs first rely on Badger-Powhatan, A Division of\n Figgie International, Inc. v. United States, in which the\n Trade Court\u2019s judgment on the merits of the case ordered a\n \u201cremand[] to the Department of Commerce International\n Trade Administration for issuance of an amended final de-\n termination\u201d with the \u201cestimated antidumping duties\n be[ing] as closely tailored to actual antidumping duties as\n is reasonable given data available to [the Department of\n Commerce] at the time the antidumping order is issued.\u201d\n 633 F. Supp. 1364, 1373 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1986). When the\n United States sought a stay pending appeal, the Trade\n Court denied the request, concluding that the judgment\n was not a monetary one subject to the automatic-stay prin-\n ciple. Badger-Powhatan, Div. of Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc. v. United\n States, 638 F. Supp. 344, 348 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1986). Unlike\n the judgment at issue in the present matter, however, the\n relevant part of the judgment in Badger-Powhatan did not\n simply order the government to pay an amount easily and\n objectively calculated, without further proceedings. In-\n deed, the Trade Court explained that \u201cthe final determina-\n tion and antidumping duty order will not result in the\n actual assessment of antidumping duties, rather importers\n will be required to deposit estimated antidumping duties.\n The permanent exchange of money will occur only after a\n\n\n\n Turkey on and after August 13, 2018 and to date has paid\n . . . $2,874,828.65 as a result of the 50% tariff.\u201d Transpa-\n cific Steel, No. 19-00009, ECF No. 19, Exhibit 3 (Ct.

The\n simple refund order at issue here is quite different.\n     Second, in National Association of Manufacturers v.\n United States Department of the Treasury, the Trade Court\n had before it a trade-association challenge to an agency\n rule, not individual importers\u2019 claims for a refund. 427 F.\n Supp. 3d 1362, 1366 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 2020). The Trade\n Court judgment declared the illegality of the agency\u2019s rule\n and then \u201c[d]eclare[d] that Defendants must process and\n pay substitution drawback claims that comply with the\n governing statutory and regulatory requirements.\u201d Nat\u2019l\n Ass\u2019n of Manufacturers v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 432 F.\n Supp. 3d 1381, 1382 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 2020). The Trade\n Court denied the government\u2019s request for a stay pending\n appeal, but all the court decided was that, under the tradi-\n tional four-factor analysis, the United States should not be\n granted a stay beyond a suspension of liquidations pending\n the appeal. See Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Manufacturers v. U.S. Dep\u2019t\n of the Treasury, No. 19-00053, 2020 WL 2519484, at *1\u20132\n (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade May 15, 2020). The Trade Court in Na-\n tional Association of Manufacturers simply never ad-\n dressed the automatic-stay principle\u2014and it was never\n asked to: In seeking a stay, the United States did not argue\n for a stay under the automatic-stay principle for money\n judgments. See No. 19-cv-00053, ECF No. 50 (Ct. Int\u2019l\n Trade Apr. 17, 2020). The denial of a stay in that case\n therefore has nothing to say about an automatic stay here.\n     In sum, I would conclude that the Trade Court\u2019s refund\n order in this case is a monetary judgment for purposes of\n the automatic-stay principle, thus rejecting the only basis\n on which plaintiffs challenge the government\u2019s request for\n an automatic stay without a bond.

(\u201cMaia\u201d) appeals from a\n judgment of the United States District Court for the Dis-\n trict of New Jersey that Maia\u2019s sincalide product infringes\n U.S. Patent 6,803,046 (\u201cthe \u2019046 patent\u201d), owned by Bracco\n Diagnostics, Inc. (\u201cBracco\u201d). J.A. 1\u20138. The court entered\n the judgment pursuant to a stipulation of infringement by\n the parties in view of the court\u2019s claim construction of the\n terms buffer, surfactant/solubilizer, and surfactant.\n Bracco Diagnostics, Inc. v. Maia Pharms., Inc., No. 3:17-cv-\n 13151, 2019 WL 4885888 (D.N.J. Oct. 3, 2019) (\u201cClaim\n Construction Order\u201d). Because Maia stipulated to infringe-\n ment under a claim construction that is essentially correct,\n we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     This appeal concerns a patent infringement action\n brought by Bracco under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Bracco\n owns the \u2019046 patent, listed in the Food and Drug Admin-\n istration\u2019s (FDA) Orange Book as covering Kinevac\u00ae, the\n active ingredient of which is sincalide. The \u2019046 patent has\n claims directed to sincalide formulations, methods for mak-\n ing and using sincalide formulations, and sincalide powder\n kits. \u2019046 patent col. 37 l. 40\u2013col. 44 l. 30. Sincalide, a\n synthetic peptide hormone, is typically administered to\n stimulate gallbladder contraction, stimulate pancreatic se-\n cretion, and accelerate the transit of a barium meal\n through the small bowel. J.A. 79\u201380, 191; \u2019046 patent col.\n 13 ll. 40\u201358. Although sincalide was originally introduced\n in 1976, the \u2019046 patent purports to teach sincalide formu-\n lations that are \u201cpurer than prior art formulations, and\n have fewer degradants and more consistent potency\u201d in\n\fCase: 20-1387     Document: 54      Page: 3    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.      3\n\n\n\n part through addition of excipients 1 such as buffers, sur-\n factants/solubilizers, and surfactants. \u2019046 patent col. 1 ll.\n 9\u201326, 46\u201349. All 36 claims at issue in this litigation require\n sincalide, a buffer, and, depending on the claim, either a\n surfactant/solubilizer or a surfactant. Id. col. 37 l. 40\u2013col.\n 40 l. 44.\n      In 2017, Maia filed a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d)\n for its own sincalide product pursuant to FDCA \u00a7 505(b)(2).\n It is undisputed that Maia\u2019s sincalide product contains\n amino acid excipients. Maia certified pursuant to \u00a7\n 505(b)(2)(A)(iv) that its sincalide product would not in-\n fringe the \u2019046 patent claims. Bracco filed suit in December\n 2017, alleging that Maia\u2019s product does infringe the claims.\n Maia denied infringement, asserting that the amino acid\n excipients in its sincalide product do not act as buffers, sur-\n factants/solubilizers, or surfactants, as required by the\n claims. Maia also counterclaimed that the claims are inva-\n lid. The parties requested that the district court construe\n the terms buffer, surfactant/solubilizer, and surfactant.\n Central to the claim construction dispute was whether the\n three terms encompass amino acids.\n     Claim 1 reads as follows:\n         1.

Claim Construction Order, 2019 WL\n 4885888, at *10. However, that does not matter here, as\n we are dealing with the same claim limitations in all of the\n claims, and can readily review their constructions.\n     In order to resolve the disputes, we turn to the claim\n language of the stipulated claims. See Phillips v. AWH\n Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). Both\n\fCase: 20-1387     Document: 54      Page: 10     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10   BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.    v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\n\n\n\n the dependent and independent claims recite the disputed\n terms buffer, surfactant/solubilizer, or surfactant. The\n scope of the dependent claims is expressly defined by nam-\n ing the intended components, through Markush claiming.\n For example, dependent claims 3, 23, and 41 recite that a\n \u201cbuffer is selected from the group consisting of a [list of ex-\n cipients, including amino acids].\u201d \u2019046 patent col. 37 ll. 51\u2013\n 60, col. 38 ll. 58\u201367, col. 39 l. 63\u2013col. 40 l. 5. The dependent\n claims that recite a surfactant and a surfactant/solubilizer\n are substantially similar. See, e.g., id. col. 39 ll. 5\u201312\n (\u201c[S]urfactant/solubilizer is selected from the group con-\n sisting of . . . .\u201d), col. 41 ll. 5\u201312 (\u201c[S]urfactant is selected\n from the group consisting of . . . .\u201d). The Markush groups\n are \u201cclosed\u201d because \u201c[u]se of the transitional phrase \u2018con-\n sisting of\u2019 to set off a patent claim element\u201d indicates that\n the claim \u201cexclude[s] any elements, steps, or ingredients\n not specified in the claim.\u201d Multilayer, 831 F.3d at 1358\n (quoting AFG Indus., Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co., 239 F.3d\n 1239, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). Thus, the dependent claims\n need no formal construction because, through the Markush\n claim drafting, the possible components are named and the\n scope of the dependent claims is thus definite and clear.\n      The independent claims also recite use of buffers, sur-\n factants/solubilizers, and surfactants in sincalide formula-\n tions, methods of making sincalide formulations, and\n sincalide kits. See, e.g., \u2019046 patent col. 37 ll. 41\u201349, col. 38\n ll. 51\u201355, col. 39 ll. 53\u201362. However, unlike the dependent\n claims, the scope of the independent claims is not expressly\n defined by naming the possible components. We will there-\n fore construe the district court\u2019s claim constructions as ap-\n plicable to the disputed independent claims.\n                            I. Buffer\n       Maia argues that the district court wrongly imported\n a list of exemplary buffers from the specification into its\n definition of the term buffer. Maia asserts that the plain\n and ordinary meaning of buffer within the context of the\n\fCase: 20-1387    Document: 54      Page: 11    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.    11\n\n\n\n patent specification is functional: \u201ca compound 3 that stabi-\n lizes the pH of a sincalide formulation.\u201d Appellant Br. at\n 43\u201344 (emphasis added); see also \u2019046 patent col. 9 ll. 45\u2013\n 47 (\u201cBuffering agents are employed to stabilize the pH of\n sincalide formulations of the invention . . . .\u201d) (emphasis\n added). According to Maia, the court eliminated the func-\n tional aspect of buffer by construing it to include excipients\n such as amino acids that do not necessarily have buffering\n effects. Maia asserts that the court\u2019s broad construction of\n buffer is contrary to its plain and ordinary meaning.\n     Maia emphasizes that its amino acids do not have buff-\n ering effects. It asserts, however, that because the district\n court defined buffer broadly to necessarily include all\n amino acids, even those that do not actually act as buffers,\n it had no choice but to stipulate to infringement. Maia ef-\n fectively interprets the court\u2019s construction to mean: an ex-\n cipient that stabilizes the pH of a sincalide formulation and\n consequently, reduces the risk of chemical [in]stability at\n extreme pH values or [all amino acids regardless of func-\n tion]. Appellant Rep. Br. at 22. In other words, Maia does\n not consider the stipulation to be an admission that its\n amino acids actually function to stabilize the pH of a sin-\n calide formulation. Rather, the stipulation is only an ad-\n mission that Maia\u2019s product has amino acids. Maia thus\n argues that if this court removes the \u201cpredetermined\u201d list\n of excipients, which includes amino acids, from the defini-\n tion of buffer, we would need to remand the case for an in-\n fringement analysis as to whether Maia\u2019s amino acids have\n buffering effects.\n     Bracco responds that the district court properly defined\n buffer to include a list of excipients from the specification.\n\n\n     3    Maia\u2019s proposed construction refers to a buffer as a\n compound. Appellant Br. at 43\u201344. The court construed\n buffer to be an \u201cexcipient.\u201d According to Maia, the distinc-\n tion is not material to the case. Appellant Rep. Br. at 16.\n\fCase: 20-1387     Document: 54      Page: 12     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12   BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.    v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\n\n\n\n Bracco first argues that the specification provides a list of\n excipients, including amino acids, that the \u201cinventors used\n to define\u201d buffer, and therefore the list must be included in\n the definition of buffer. Appellee Br. at 27 (citing \u2019046 pa-\n tent col. 9 ll. 45\u201365). Bracco also points to dependent\n claims, like claim 3, which recite that \u201ca buffer is selected\n from the group consisting of\u201d a substantially similar list of\n exemplary buffers as those listed in the specification. Ap-\n pellee Br. at 27.\n      According to Bracco, any error in claim construction is\n harmless. It rejects Maia\u2019s argument that it only stipu-\n lated to having amino acids in its product, not that its\n amino acids have buffering effects. Bracco asserts that\n Maia is misconstruing the district court\u2019s construction of\n the three terms in the stipulation \u201cas somehow reading out\n the functions required by the terms.\u201d Appellee Br. at 16.\n Bracco states that when Maia stipulated to infringement,\n Maia effectively agreed that \u201ceach of [its] two amino acids\n is a \u2018buffer\u2019 excipient with a \u2018buffer\u2019 effect, which is [a]n ex-\n cipient that: stabilizes the pH of sincalide formulations . . .\n .\u201d Id. at 16\u201317. Bracco thus argues that the court\u2019s re-\n moval of the exemplary list has no effect on the infringe-\n ment analysis. Maia is foreclosed, Bracco argues, from\n asserting that its amino acids do not have buffering effects\n in view of the stipulation. Bracco also asserts that extrinsic\n evidence demonstrates that Maia\u2019s amino acids function as\n buffers. However, Bracco does not cite any portion of the\n claim construction order or final judgment demonstrating\n that the court took into account evidentiary findings re-\n garding the function of Maia\u2019s amino acids.\n     We agree with Maia that the district court technically\n erred in importing a list of excipients into its definition of\n buffer. Listing numerous compounds that meet the lan-\n guage of a functional term in a claim confuses construing\n what the function is with what compounds perform that\n function. The latter is not the task of claim construction,\n which is to provide definitional meaning to claim language.\n\fCase: 20-1387     Document: 54       Page: 13     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.    v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.       13\n\n\n\n The court correctly did that when it stated that a buffer,\n for purposes of this invention, is \u201c[a]n excipient that: stabi-\n lizes the pH of sincalide formulations of the invention, and\n consequently, reduces the risk of chemical [in]stability at\n extreme pH values.\u201d Claim Construction Order, 2019 WL\n 4885888, at *10. That construction by the district court\n was correct, and the court\u2019s technical error of then listing\n from the specification a long list of compounds meeting that\n meaning does not invalidate that functional construction.\n And claim 3 then recites that the buffer in claim 1 includes\n one or more amino acids. That technical error was thus\n harmless. Maia then stipulated to infringement.\n     The key language of its stipulation reads as follows:\n \u201cUnder the Court\u2019s construction of the disputed claim\n terms of the \u2019046 patent, . . . Maia\u2019s 505(b)(2) NDA Product\n would literally infringe the 36 claims.\u201d J.A. 3673; see also\n J.A. 5\u20136. That stipulation forecloses the argument for non-\n infringement.\n      Maia argues that it had no choice but to stipulate to\n infringement because the district court\u2019s construction re-\n moved the functional aspect of buffer and predetermined\n that Maia\u2019s amino acids have buffering effects. But the dis-\n trict court did not \u201cremove\u201d the functional definition of\n buffer. The court correctly included the functional defini-\n tion in its claim construction. Maia asks us to effectively\n reinterpret the court\u2019s construction to mean: an excipient\n that stabilizes the pH . . . buffering agents to include . . .\n [all amino acids regardless of function]. But that was not\n the stipulation.\n      Maia also points to a \u201cwhereas\u201d clause in the stipula-\n tion stating that \u201cthe [district court\u2019s] construction, explic-\n itly defining \u2018buffer\u2019 . . . to include \u2018amino acids,\u2019 alone forms\n the basis for Maia\u2019s admission and stipulation.\u201d Appellant\n Rep. Br. at 23 (citing J.A. 3671) (emphasis added). But that\n is also not what the stipulation says, and we do not rely on\n a self-serving \u201cwhereas\u201d clause to override the clear import\n\fCase: 20-1387    Document: 54      Page: 14     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14   BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v.

That clause is directly contradictory to\n Maia\u2019s admission in the other portion of the stipulation\n that its product meets \u201cevery element and claim term\u201d of\n the claims. J.A. 3669. Moreover, even Maia admits that\n the \u201cwhereas\u201d clause is neither binding nor conclusive. Ap-\n pellant Rep. Br. at 23.\n      Maia similarly argued that the claims are invalid as\n inoperable, because, it asserts, amino acids are not buffers.\n However, it relinquished those arguments when it stipu-\n lated to infringement and dismissal of its counterclaims of\n invalidity. J.A. 6, 3673. Consequently, contrary to Maia\u2019s\n assertion, it did have an opportunity to assert that its\n amino acids do not function as \u201cbuffering agents\u201d because\n they do not \u201cstabilize the pH.\u201d To the extent that Maia be-\n lieved the district court\u2019s construction had a particular\n meaning, it never sought clarification from the court, and\n that issue, in light of the stipulation, is now beyond the\n scope of this appeal. J.A. 3670. Having entered into a stip-\n ulation, Maia is now bound by it. See Inventio AG v. Otis\n Elevator Co., 497 F. App\u2019x 37, 41 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (rejecting\n a party\u2019s argument that it did not stipulate to a certain fact\n because the wording of the stipulation \u201csuggests otherwise,\n and it is to that stipulation [the party] is bound\u201d); United\n States v. Penland, 370 F. App\u2019x 381, 383 (4th Cir. 2010) (re-\n jecting party\u2019s attempt to disavow \u201cunambiguous language\n set forth in the [s]tipulation\u201d); United States v.

See, e.g., SUFI Network Servs., inc. v. United\n States, 755 F.3d 1305, 1312 (Fed.

MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.     15\n\n\n\n the issues on appeal are legal, not factual, we see no need\n to remand\u201d).\n                  II. Surfactant/Solubilizer\n     We turn next to Maia\u2019s argument that the district court\n erred in construing the term surfactant/solubilizer. Maia\n again argues here that the court wrongly imported a list of\n exemplary surfactants/solubilizers from the specification\n into the definition. Maia also argues that the court improp-\n erly construed the backslash between surfactant/solubil-\n izer to mean \u201cand\u201d or \u201cor\u201d rather than \u201cand.\u201d We address\n each argument in turn.\n      With regard to the first issue, Maia argues that the dis-\n trict court \u201ceviscerated\u201d the functional aspect of the term\n surfactant/solubilizer by importing a list of exemplary ex-\n cipients into its definition regardless as to whether they ac-\n tually function as such. We agree with Maia that the\n district court technically erred in importing a list of excip-\n ients into its definition of surfactant/solubilizer. But, as\n with the term buffer, inclusion of the list of exemplary sur-\n factant/solubilizer agents, while technically incorrect, is es-\n sentially correct in its functional definition. As a result,\n the court\u2019s technical error is harmless.\n     Our analysis here is similar to our analysis regarding\n the district court\u2019s error in construing buffer. The district\n court correctly included the functional definition in its\n claim construction. Its construction reads that a surfac-\n tant/solubilizer \u201cmay reduce the interfacial tension or aid\n in solubilization thus preventing or reducing denaturation\n and/or degradation at air/liquid or liquid/solid interfaces of\n the product in solution.\u201d Claim Construction Order, 2019\n WL 4885888, at *10. Inclusion of the sentence \u201cthe addi-\n tion of a nonionic surfactant, such as polysorbate,\u201d along\n with an exemplary list of surfactant/solubilizer agents,\n does not invalidate the functional portion of the construc-\n tion. Moreover, as with buffer, claim 6 recites that the sur-\n factant/solubilizer includes amino acids. \u2019046 patent col. 37\n\fCase: 20-1387    Document: 54     Page: 16    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16   BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\n\n\n\n l. 65\u2013col. 38 l. 5. Maia\u2019s product includes amino acids and\n thus it stipulated to infringement. When Maia stipulated\n to infringement under the court\u2019s claim construction, it\n stipulated to infringing every limitation of the claims, not\n just to having amino acids. Having entered into a stipula-\n tion, Maia is bound by it.\n      We now turn to Maia\u2019s second argument. Maia argues\n that the district court wrongly construed surfactant/solu-\n bilizer to mean a surfactant \u201cand\u201d or \u201cor\u201d a solubilizer, ra-\n ther than a surfactant that is also a solubilizer. As support\n for its position, Maia argues that the specification sets\n forth a pattern of using a backslash to describe one excipi-\n ent that has multiple functions. For example, in Table 1,\n mannitol is reported to function as a \u201cbulking agent/cake\n forming agent/tonicity adjuster.\u201d \u2019046 patent cols. 3\u20134 Ta-\n ble 1. According to Maia, the table indicates that mannitol\n is a bulking agent [and] cake forming agent [and] tonicity\n adjuster. Appellant Br. at 34. Maia further argues that\n the district court\u2019s construction of \u201csurfactant/solubilizer\u201d\n to mean a surfactant or solubilizer would allow the claims\n to encompass sincalide formulations without surfactants.\n According to Maia, that impermissibly broadens the scope\n of the claims beyond that supported by the specification be-\n cause every embodiment and description of the invention\n in the patent requires a surfactant. Maia points to Table 1\n and example 7, both of which include sincalide formula-\n tions comprising surfactants, and statements in the speci-\n fication that the formulation includes a surfactant.\n     Bracco responds that the specification supports its con-\n struction of the backslash to mean \u201cand\u201d or \u201cor.\u201d With re-\n spect to Maia\u2019s argument that the specification only\n discloses embodiments comprising surfactants, Bracco ar-\n gues that Maia attempts to impermissibly read preferred\n embodiments into the claim. It asserts that the patent\u2019s\n disclosure contains no disclaimer of sincalide formulations\n without surfactants and that, on the contrary, there are\n several examples of formulations in the specification that\n\fCase: 20-1387     Document: 54       Page: 17      Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.    v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.        17\n\n\n\n do not contain surfactants, including those described in ta-\n bles 8 and 9. With regard to Maia\u2019s argument that the\n specification uses the backslash in Table 1 to define a sin-\n gle excipient that has more than one function, Bracco as-\n serts that the backslash could also be construed in that\n context to mean \u201cor.\u201d For example, in Table 1, mannitol\n can be a bulking agent [or] a cake forming agent [or] a to-\n nicity adjuster. Appellee Br. at 46.\n       We agree with Bracco that the district court correctly\n construed the backslash in surfactant/solubilizer to mean\n \u201cand\u201d or \u201cor.\u201d Beginning with the claim language, the plain\n reading of the claims is that the backslash means \u201cand\u201d or\n \u201cor.\u201d Claim 1, in relevant part recites: \u201cA stabilized, phys-\n iologically acceptable formulation of sincalide comprising:\n . . . (c) a surfactant/solubilizer . . . .\u201d \u2019046 patent col. 37 ll.\n 41\u201349 (emphasis added). Claim 7 depends from claim 1\n and recites: \u201cThe formulation of claim 1, wherein said sur-\n factant is a nonionic surfactant.\u201d Id. col. 38 ll. 6\u20137 (empha-\n sis added). Dependent claim 7\u2019s recitation of a formulation\n with only a surfactant lends credence to Bracco\u2019s argument\n that the backslash can mean \u201cor\u201d and not necessarily \u201cand.\u201d\n     We next turn to the specification. Maia argues that\n this specification requires a construction of the backslash\n to mean only \u201cand.\u201d             However, Maia\u2019s argument is\n grounded solely on this specification\u2019s ambiguous language\n and its disclosure of a few preferred embodiments of the\n patent that include sincalide formulations comprising sur-\n factants. For example, Maia argues that the specification\n sets forth a pattern of using a backslash when describing\n multiple functions performed by the same excipient, as ex-\n emplified by Table 1. However, as Bracco points out, the\n backslash in Table 1 can also be interpreted to mean \u201cor.\u201d\n Additionally, all of Maia\u2019s quotes from the specification ref-\n erence a preferred embodiment. Appellant Br. at 35\u201336\n (quoting \u2019046 patent col 1 ll. 56\u201362 (\u201cIn one aspect, the in-\n vention features sincalide formulations that include . . . a\n surfactant . . . .\u201d), col. 2 ll. 1\u20132 (\u201cIn various embodiments of\n\fCase: 20-1387    Document: 54      Page: 18    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18   BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\n\n\n\n the invention, the surfactant is a nonionic surfactant . . .\n .\u201d)) (emphases added). Maia omits that the specification\u2019s\n disclosure that \u201c[t]he sincalide formulations of the inven-\n tion can include a variety of excipients, such as, for[] exam-\n ple . . . surfactants,\u201d indicates that surfactants are not\n necessary. \u2019046 patent col. 4 ll. 8\u201312 (emphases added).\n Here, although the specification discloses a few preferred\n embodiments of sincalide formulations with surfactants,\n Maia has not demonstrated that the patentee has a \u201cclear\n intention to limit the claim scope.\u201d Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v.\n Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n     We thus conclude that the district court correctly con-\n strued the backslash in surfactant/solubilizer to mean\n \u201cand\u201d or \u201cor.\u201d\n                        III. Surfactant\n      Lastly, Maia argues that the district court erred in con-\n struing the term surfactant to mean \u201can excipient that may\n reduce the interfacial tension.\u201d Maia asserts that in con-\n struing surfactant, the court improperly imported into the\n definition ambiguous and non-definitional language from\n the specification\u2014\u201c[t]he addition of a nonionic surfactant.\n . . may reduce the interfacial tension.\u201d See \u2019046 patent col.\n 11 ll. 27\u201334 (emphasis added). Maia argues that because\n every excipient \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cmay not\u201d reduce interfacial ten-\n sion, under the court\u2019s construction, a surfactant encom-\n passes \u201cevery excipient in the universe,\u201d including\n excipients that increase interfacial tension or are nonfunc-\n tional. Appellant Br. at 20. Maia argues that as a result,\n the court\u2019s construction is contrary to the plain and ordi-\n nary meaning of the term.\n     According to Maia, the plain and ordinary meaning of\n surfactant in view of the specification as a whole is a com-\n pound that \u201cmust\u201d reduce the interfacial tension at the\n air/liquid or liquid/solid interfaces. Appellant Rep. Br. at\n 18. As support for Maia\u2019s narrower construction, it states\n that the only disclosed surfactant effect in the specification\n\fCase: 20-1387     Document: 54      Page: 19    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.      19\n\n\n\n is the reduction of interfacial tension at the air/liquid or\n liquid/solid interface rather than any increase in interfa-\n cial tension. Maia points to the specification\u2019s disclosure\n that a nonionic surfactant may \u201creduce the interfacial ten-\n sion . . . at air/liquid or liquid/solid interfaces . . . .\u201d See\n \u2019046 patent col. 11 ll. 27\u201334. (emphases added). Maia also\n points to Example 3 of the patent, entitled \u201cEffect of Sur-\n factants on Sincalide Formulations,\u201d to support its argu-\n ment. Example 3 states, in relevant part, that use of even\n trace amounts of a surfactant \u201cstill produced a significant\n effect on the air/liquid interface.\u201d \u2019046 patent col. 22 ll. 28\u2013\n 30 (emphases added). Maia states that the \u201ceffect\u201d refers\n to an increase in potency attributed to the surfactant\u2019s re-\n duction of surface tension at the air/liquid interface. Maia\n further cites several dictionaries that define surfactant to\n mean an excipient that necessarily reduces interfacial ten-\n sion at the air/liquid or liquid/solid interface.\n     Bracco responds that the district court\u2019s construction is\n accurate in light of the specification\u2019s explicit disclosure\n that a surfactant \u201cmay reduce the interfacial tension.\u201d\n Bracco disagrees with Maia\u2019s position that the court\u2019s use\n of \u201cmay\u201d in the definition renders the term meaningless.\n According to Bracco, a person of skill would interpret \u201cmay\u201d\n to mean \u201ccapable of under certain circumstances.\u201d Appel-\n lee Br. at 14. As support, Bracco cites expert testimony.\n Thus, Bracco argues that the court\u2019s construction would in-\n clude only surfactants that can, or are capable of, reducing\n interfacial tension, but would not include \u201ceverything in\n the universe.\u201d Id. at 13.\n     Bracco also argues that Maia is improperly loading ad-\n ditional limitations onto the term from the specification by\n requiring that surfactant be construed as an excipient that\n must reduce interfacial tension at certain interfaces.\n Bracco contends that the patentee has made no clear and\n unmistakable disclaimer that the definition of surfactant\n should be limited in the manner that Maia proposes. With\n regard to Maia\u2019s argument that the specification discloses\n\fCase: 20-1387     Document: 54       Page: 20     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 20   BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.     v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\n\n\n\n several statements and examples that surfactants reduce\n interfacial tension at the air/liquid or liquid/solid interface,\n Bracco responds that language referring to one preferred\n embodiment of a surfactant, does not so limit all surfac-\n tants. Id. at 39 (\u201c[T]he addition of a nonionic surfactant,\n such as polysorbate, to the formulation, may reduce the in-\n terfacial tension . . . at air/liquid or liquid/solid interfaces.\u201d\n (quoting \u2019046 patent col. 11 ll. 29\u201334)) (emphasis added).\n     Bracco further contends that Maia misrepresents Ex-\n ample 3 as supporting its argument that the only surfac-\n tant effect disclosed in the patent is reduction of interfacial\n tension. According to Bracco, Maia purports to quote from\n Example 3\u2019s disclosure that a nonionic surfactant \u201cstill pro-\n duced a significant effect on the air/liquid interface,\u201d and\n misleadingly ascribes that \u201ceffect\u201d to increase in potency\n resulting from a surfactant\u2019s reduction of interfacial ten-\n sion, while cropping the next line, which actually explains\n that the effect was the elimination of \u201cfoaming in the for-\n mulation.\u201d \u2019046 patent col. 22 ll. 28\u201331. Bracco addition-\n ally asserts that Maia\u2019s requirement that surfactants\n function at the air/liquid or liquid/solid interface does not\n comport with claim 40, which is directed to a powder mix-\n ture kit that has no liquid present.\n     With regard to the extrinsic evidence proffered by\n Maia, Bracco asserts that a person of ordinary skill, which\n Bracco contends is a peptide drug formulator, would not\n look to dictionaries to learn about the formulation of a pep-\n tide drug; according to Bracco, formulation of peptide drugs\n presents highly specialized technical issues and a diction-\n ary would not be of use to a skilled peptide formulator.\n Bracco points out that several of Maia\u2019s dictionaries reject\n Maia\u2019s narrow construction of \u201csurfactant\u201d in favor of de-\n fining it as \u201cusually\u201d effecting other properties and other\n interfaces. J.A. 587. Lastly, Bracco asserts that Maia\u2019s\n construction does not take into account evidence that a per-\n son of skill would consider a surfactant to have other effects\n\fCase: 20-1387    Document: 54      Page: 21     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.     21\n\n\n\n including inhibition in aggregation, improvement in solu-\n bility, and reduction of adsorption.\n      We agree with Bracco that the district court correctly\n construed the term surfactant. First, contrary to Maia\u2019s\n assertion, the court\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in its construc-\n tion does not render surfactant meaningless. We agree\n with Maia that \u201cmay,\u201d standing alone, presents some am-\n biguity. However, the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cmay\u201d\n within the context of this specification is properly under-\n stood as indicating an inherent measure of likelihood or\n possibility. It is not used by a person of skill to describe an\n event that has no likelihood of occurring. For example, the\n specification discloses that \u201c[t]he addition of a nonionic sur-\n factant . . . may reduce the interfacial tension\u201d and contin-\n ues to provide an exemplary list of surfactants/solubilizers.\n \u2019046 patent col. 11 ll. 26\u201363 (emphasis added). It is unlikely\n that the patentee intended to provide an exemplary list of\n surfactants/solubilizers that could never be capable of re-\n ducing interfacial tension. Even Maia acknowledges that\n \u201cmay\u201d encompasses possibility or probability in its brief.\n Appellant Br. at 19 (\u201cIt is undisputed that the term \u2018may\u2019\n is permissive, used to indicate possibility.\u201d). It follows that\n the district court\u2019s definition includes excipients that re-\n duce interfacial tension, or are capable of reducing interfa-\n cial tension, but excludes excipients that can never reduce\n interfacial tension. Thus, the term is not meaningless, as\n Maia alleges.\n      We further disagree with Maia\u2019s argument that the\n specification expressly indicates that surfactants must re-\n duce interfacial tension at the air/liquid or liquid/solid in-\n terface. First, the specification\u2019s disclosure that one type\n of surfactant \u201cmay reduce the interfacial tension,\u201d supports\n the district court\u2019s construction that surfactants need not\n necessarily reduce interfacial tension. \u2019046 patent col. 11\n ll. 29\u201334 (emphasis added). Maia recites a few lines from\n the description section and from a preferred embodiment\n as support for its limitation. However, none of Maia\u2019s\n\fCase: 20-1387    Document: 54     Page: 22    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 22   BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v. MAIA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\n\n\n\n references indicates that the patentee intended to limit the\n claim scope in the manner that it asserts. For example,\n Maia argues that Example 3 demonstrates that the pur-\n pose of surfactants is to increase potency through reduction\n of interfacial tension, although Bracco rightly points out\n that the \u201ceffect\u201d could be referring to foaming. Id. col. 22\n ll. 28\u201331. We have repeatedly \u201ccautioned against limiting\n the claimed invention to preferred embodiments or specific\n examples in the specification,\u201d where, like here, the pa-\n tentee has not made a clear disavowal of the claim scope.\n Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett & Platt, Inc., 805 F.3d\n 1102, 1109\u201310 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting Williamson v. Cit-\n rix Online, LLC, 792 F.3d 1339, 1346\u201347 (Fed. Cir. 2015));\n see also Ericsson, Inc. v.

Cir. 2014) (\u201c[I]t is important that we avoid im-\n porting limitations from the specification into the claims.\u201d)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).\n     Moreover, the district court\u2019s construction is supported\n by the extrinsic evidence. In construing surfactant, the\n court relied on Dr. Forrest\u2019s testimony that a peptide for-\n mulator in 2002 was aware that surfactants usually, but\n not necessarily, reduce interfacial tension. The court found\n his testimony \u201cmore thorough and reli[ant] upon a more\n authoritative list of sources\u201d than Maia\u2019s expert, Dr.\n Klibanov, who asserted that surfactants must reduce inter-\n facial tension at certain interfaces. Claim Construction Or-\n der, 2019 WL 4885888, at *8. We do not see, nor does Maia\n allege, any clear error in the court\u2019s reliance on Dr. For-\n rest\u2019s testimony over Dr. Klibanov\u2019s testimony.\n                        CONCLUSION\n     We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments\n but find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing reasons, we\n conclude that while the district court technically erred in\n construing the terms buffer, surfactant/solubilizer, and\n surfactant, its construction is essentially correct. We\n therefore affirm the judgment of infringement.\n\fCase: 20-1387   Document: 54      Page: 23    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n BRACCO DIAGNOSTICS INC.   v.

Petitioners\nand Intertrust move unopposed to exceed the confidential\nword limits of Federal Circuit Rule 25.1(d)(1). 1\n                             I.\n    These cases concern technology used in the movie in-\ndustry to securely distribute digital content. Like the par-\nties, the court will refer to this technology as \u201cDCI-\ncompliant\u201d technology, named after the company, Digital\nCinema Initiatives, LLC, formed by the major motion pic-\nture studios to develop such industry-wide standards.\nDolby Laboratories, Inc. is one producer of DCI-compliant\ncomponents, including, as most relevant here, components\nreferred to as image media blocks (\u201cIMBs\u201d).\n    Petitioners here, Cinemark, AMC, and Regal, operate\nmovie theatres and incorporate IMBs from Dolby as well as\nother producers into DCI-compliant equipment suites.\nThey are headquartered in Plano, Texas; Leawood, Kan-\nsas; and Knoxville, Tennessee; respectively. Intertrust\nbrought these suits (which have been consolidated for pre-\ntrial proceedings) in the Eastern District of Texas, alleging\nthat petitioners directly infringed method and apparatus\nclaims of eleven of Intertrust\u2019s patents through petitioners\u2019\nuse of these equipment suites.\n    Intertrust filed these suits against petitioners in Au-\ngust 2019. A few months earlier, Intertrust was sued in\nthe Northern District of California by Dolby, seeking a\n\n\n    1   The court notes that the parties\u2019 motions to waive\nthe confidentiality requirements were premised on the fact\nthat the district court\u2019s order denying transfer and the un-\nderlying transcript were filed under seal. Those documents\nhave since been unsealed. See Intertrust Techs. Corp. v.\nCinemark Holdings, Inc., No. 2:19-cv-00266-JRG, ECF\nNos. 157, 167 (E.D. Tex. 2020).\n\fCase: 21-103    Document: 20       Page: 3   Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\nIN RE: CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC.                                   3\n\n\n\ndeclaratory judgment that its sale of IMBs to petitioners\nand other customers did not directly or indirectly infringe\nthe same patents asserted in the underlying actions\nagainst petitioners. Intertrust counterclaimed for direct\nand contributory infringement. Although petitioners are\nnot parties to the California lawsuit, they jointly moved the\nTexas court to transfer these actions to the Northern Dis-\ntrict of California, arguing primarily that transfer was\nwarranted under the first-to-file rule.\n    The district court denied the motion on September 30,\n2020. The court recognized that the first-filed action is gen-\nerally given preference when identical or highly related\nsuits are filed in separate courts but held that such prefer-\nence did not warrant transfer because \u201cthere is not an iden-\ntity of parties or infringement allegations\u201d and that\npetitioners\u2019 \u201calleged infringement does not completely co-\nincide with that of Dolby and the resolution of the Dolby\nAction will not moot the issues presented here.\u201d Intertrust\nTechs. Corp. v. Cinemark Holdings, Inc., No. 2:19-cv-\n00266-JRG, slip op. at 17 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 2020). The\ncourt further found that petitioners had not shown that the\nNorthern District of California was a clearly more conven-\nient forum based on the traditional factors bearing on a 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) analysis. Petitioners now seek mandamus\nreview of that ruling.\n                             II.\n     The basics for obtaining transfer under either the first-\nto-file rule or \u00a7 1404(a) are generally straightforward. Un-\nder the first-to-file rule, where there is complete or nearly\ncomplete overlap between two cases, the usual rule is for\nthe court of first jurisdiction to resolve the issues. See\nMerial Ltd. v Cipla Ltd., 681 F.3d 1283, 1299 (Fed. Cir.\n2012); West Gulf Mar. Ass\u2019n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, 751\nF.2d 721, 730 (5th Cir. 1985). Under \u00a7 1404(a), the movant\nmust \u201cclearly demonstrate that a transfer is \u2018[f]or the con-\nvenience of parties and witnesses, [and] in the interest of\n\fCase: 21-103    Document: 20      Page: 4    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                             IN RE: CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC.\n\n\n\n\njustice.\u2019\u201d In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 545 F.3d 304 (5th\nCir. 2008) (en banc) (quoting \u00a7 1404(a)). A district court\ngenerally has considerable discretion in deciding whether\nto transfer under either rule, and we review its decision on\nmandamus only for a clear abuse of discretion. See In re\nTS Tech USA Corp., 551 F.3d 1315, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2008).\n    We cannot say petitioners have shown that the district\ncourt\u2019s first-to-file rule determination amounted to a clear\nabuse of discretion. Whereas the California action focuses\non Dolby\u2019s IMBs, these suits focus on petitioners\u2019 use of\nequipment suites, some of which use IMBs made by pro-\nducers other than Dolby. Intertrust contends, moreover,\nthat other components used in petitioners\u2019 equipment\nsuites aside from IMBs can independently meet most of the\nsame limitations for the claims asserted here. For these\nreasons, the issues of infringement are not clearly common\nbetween the cases and resolution of the California action\nwould not necessarily resolve the Texas cases. 2 Thus, the\ndistrict court here had at least a plausible basis to conclude\nthat transfer of these cases would not likely reduce piece-\nmeal resolution and minimize the possibility of embarrass-\ning inconsistent results that the first-to-file rule was\ndesigned to prevent.\n    Apart from the first-to-file rule, petitioners also chal-\nlenge the district court\u2019s analysis of the \u00a7 1404(a) conven-\nience factors. Under applicable Fifth Circuit law, we\nreview those determinations only to see if the district\n\n\n    2   For these reasons alone, among others, we must\nalso reject any suggestion that the district court erred in\napplying the principles underlying the so-called customer-\nsuit exception. See Kahn v. Gen. Motors Corp., 889 F.2d\n1078, 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (declining to apply the excep-\ntion where there was no evidence that the later filed action\n\u201cwould resolve all charges against the customers in the\nstayed suit, including liability for damages\u201d).\n\fCase: 21-103     Document: 20     Page: 5   Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\nIN RE: CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC.                                  5\n\n\n\ncourt\u2019s refusal to transfer amounted to a patently errone-\nous result. See TS Tech, 551 F.3d at 1319. We cannot say\nthat such result occurred here. The district court consid-\nered all the relevant factors based on the record before it.\nIt noted that Intertrust\u2019s chosen forum, located in the dis-\ntrict in which Cinemark is headquartered and much closer\nto the headquarters of the other petitioners, would be con-\nvenient for certain relevant documents and physical evi-\ndence as well as witnesses of petitioners and at least one\nthird-party witness from Dolby who has personal\nknowledge of the development of the DCI standard. Under\nsimilar circumstances, where no defendant is headquar-\ntered in the proposed transferee venue, this court has not\npreviously granted mandamus, and we see no reason to\ngrant such extraordinary relief here.\n      Accordingly,\n      IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n   (1) Intertrust\u2019s motion to file a sur-reply brief is\ngranted. ECF No. 15-2 is accepted for filing.\n      (2) The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.\n   (3) The motions to exceed the confidential word limits\n(ECF Nos. 4 and 10) are denied as moot.\n                                 FOR THE COURT\n\n        December 17, 2020        /s/ Peter R.

UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n\n    Before NEWMAN, LOURIE, and CHEN, Circuit Judges.\n LOURIE, Circuit Judge.\n     McLeod Group, LLC (\u201cMcLeod\u201d) appeals from a deci-\n sion of the United States Court of Federal Claims (the\n \u201cClaims Court\u201d) dismissing Counts I, II, and V of McLeod\u2019s\n complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See\n McLeod Grp., LLC v. United States, 142 Fed. Cl. 558\n (2019). The court held that a blanket purchase agreement\n (\u201cBPA\u201d) between McLeod and the United States Depart-\n ment of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) was not a binding con-\n tract subject to appellate jurisdiction under the Tucker Act,\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a). For the reasons below, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     On September 29, 2011, DHS awarded a BPA to\n McLeod to, inter alia, provide DHS with management con-\n sulting services and to evaluate and recommend improve-\n ments in organizational structure, mission, and\n organization of core lines of business. The BPA states that\n the agreement \u201cdoes not obligate any funds\u201d and that \u201cTask\n Orders will be placed against this BPA by DHS\u201d for partic-\n ular services. J.A. 84; J.A. 86. There is no dispute in this\n case that the task orders issued pursuant to the BPA, as\n opposed to the BPA itself, are contractual agreements. The\n BPA also states that the agreement is \u201cnot a contract\u201d with\n the government. J.A. 86.\n     DHS issued seven task orders to McLeod under the\n BPA, during the period of September 30, 2011 through\n September 11, 2014. On October 4, 2016, McLeod submit-\n ted a certified claim to the DHS contracting officer alleging,\n inter alia, that DHS failed to execute its contractual re-\n sponsibilities under the BPA in a good-faith and trusted\n manner, and that the agency acted in bad faith by not is-\n suing additional within-scope task orders to McLeod. The\n\fCase: 20-1389    Document: 29      Page: 3    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCLEOD GROUP, LLC   v. UNITED STATES                       3\n\n\n\n DHS contracting officer denied McLeod\u2019s claim on May 3,\n 2017 for failure to articulate a proper basis for the claim.\n     McLeod filed a complaint in the Claims Court on\n May 2, 2018, alleging that various DHS offices and officers\n breached their contractual obligations, acted in bad faith,\n and abused their discretion in the performance and admin-\n istration of McLeod\u2019s BPA and task orders. On August 31,\n 2018, DHS filed a partial motion to dismiss Counts I, II,\n and V (the \u201cBPA claims\u201d) of McLeod\u2019s complaint for lack of\n subject matter jurisdiction. The court granted the govern-\n ment\u2019s motion on April 4, 2019. It held that it did not pos-\n sess jurisdiction to consider the BPA claims because\n McLeod failed to \u201cestablish that the BPA itself is a con-\n tract\u201d with the government \u201cthat can be relied upon to es-\n tablish [subject matter] jurisdiction in this case.\u201d McLeod\n Grp., LLC v. United States, 142 Fed. Cl. 558, 563\u201365\n (2019). After reviewing the complaint and the BPA, the\n court found that there is an \u201cabsence of mutuality of con-\n sideration in the BPA\u201d and that the BPA language shows\n that the parties did not intend for the BPA to be a contract.\n J.A. 13\u201314. On October 30, 2019, McLeod filed an unop-\n posed motion for entry of partial final judgment with re-\n spect to the BPA claims, which the Claims Court granted\n on November 14, 2019. McLeod timely filed a notice of ap-\n peal on January 13, 2020.\n                         DISCUSSION\n     We review de novo the decision of the Court of Federal\n Claims to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States\n Court of Federal Claims. RadioShack Corp. v. United\n States, 566 F.3d 1358, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Under the\n Tucker Act, the Claims Court has \u201cjurisdiction to render\n judgment upon any claim against the United States\n founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the\n United States[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act\n also gives the court jurisdiction over claims or disputes\n\fCase: 20-1389    Document: 29      Page: 4    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                        MCLEOD GROUP, LLC   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n arising under the Contract Disputes Act.            See id.\n \u00a7 1491(a)(2); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(b)(1); see also Crewzers Fire\n Crew Transp., Inc. v. United States, 741 F.3d 1380, 1382\n n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2014). \u201cThe party invoking jurisdiction has\n the burden to show compliance with the Tucker Act.\u201d\n Trauma Serv. Grp. v. United States, 104 F.3d 1321, 1324\n (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing Reynolds v. Army & Air Force Exch.\n Serv., 846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). \u201cTo invoke the\n Court of Federal Claims\u2019s jurisdiction under the Tucker\n Act, a contractor must first show that its claims arose out\n of a valid contract with the United States.\u201d Crewzers, 741\n F.3d at 1382.\n     A contract with the government requires (1) mutuality\n of intent, (2) consideration, (3) an unambiguous offer and\n acceptance, and (4) actual authority on the part of the gov-\n ernment\u2019s representative to bind the government in con-\n tract. See Kam-Almaz v. United States, 682 F.3d 1364,\n 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Night Vision Corp. v. United States,\n 469 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A failure of any of\n these requirements precludes the existence of a valid con-\n tract. Thus, an \u201cabsence of mutuality of obligation leads to\n the conclusion that the parties lacked the requisite contrac-\n tual intent.\u201d Modern Sys. Tech. Corp. v. United States, 979\n F.2d 200, 206 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Agreement language plac-\n ing no obligation on a contractor to accept an order from\n the government \u201ccannot provide the consideration neces-\n sary to create a binding contract.\u201d Crewzers, 741 F.3d at\n 1383. This court has held that BPAs that do not impose\n any binding obligations on the parties are not contracts.\n See id. at 1384.\n     McLeod argues that the Claims Court erred by apply-\n ing a heightened pleading standard that required McLeod\n to establish the existence of a contract rather than merely\n a non-frivolous allegation of a contract with the govern-\n ment. Appellant\u2019s Br. 12. McLeod argues that jurisdiction\n is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might\n\fCase: 20-1389     Document: 29     Page: 5    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCLEOD GROUP, LLC   v. UNITED STATES                        5\n\n\n\n fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could ac-\n tually recover, and the normal disposition would be to dis-\n miss the complaint for failure to state a claim, rather than\n for want of jurisdiction. Id. at 14. McLeod asserts that\n when the existence of the contract turns on questions of\n fact and the terms of the contract in dispute, the Court of\n Federal Claims must first take jurisdiction before deciding\n contract term meanings. Id. According to McLeod, if dis-\n missal is warranted because the alleged contract does not\n exist, the proper basis for such a dismissal is failure to\n state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Id. McLeod\n asserts that it made a non-frivolous allegation that the\n BPA is a binding contract; thus, the Claims Court has ju-\n risdiction over the BPA claims and dismissal was unwar-\n ranted.\n     McLeod alleges that the BPA includes all the required\n elements of a binding contract. Regarding mutuality of in-\n tent, McLeod asserts that the issuance and performance of\n seven task orders pursuant to the BPA support McLeod\u2019s\n allegation that the BPA is a mutually acknowledged and\n binding agreement between the parties. Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 19. With regard to whether the BPA lacks consideration,\n McLeod asserts that it credibly alleged that both McLeod\n and DHS provided valuable consideration. McLeod argues\n that DHS provided consideration by promising that\n McLeod would be afforded the opportunity to bid on all\n available opportunities under the BPA. Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 26\u201327. McLeod argues that various BPA provisions impose\n obligations on McLeod that relate independently to the\n BPA, including that McLeod \u201cshall be required\u201d to \u201c[a]ttend\n a post-award kickoff meeting.\u201d J.A. 92; Appellant\u2019s Br. 26.\n     The government responds that the Claims Court ap-\n plied the proper pleading standard by requiring McLeod to\n demonstrate the existence of a valid contract in order to\n invoke the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. The govern-\n ment argues that the court properly required McLeod to\n\fCase: 20-1389     Document: 29      Page: 6     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                         MCLEOD GROUP, LLC    v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n allege facts that would establish that the BPA is a contract,\n a showing that McLeod could not make, given precedent\n holding that a BPA like McLeod\u2019s is not a contract. Appel-\n lee\u2019s Br. 14. According to the government, the court\n properly found that McLeod did not meet that burden by\n failing to show at least mutuality of intent and considera-\n tion. Id. at 19. The government thus contends that the\n Court of Federal Claims properly dismissed the BPA\n claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. at 9.\n      We agree with the government, and the Claims Court,\n that McLeod failed to present a non-frivolous allegation\n that the BPA at issue here is a binding contract. To invoke\n the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and\n the Contract Disputes Act, a contractor must show that its\n claims arose out of a valid contract with the United States.\n See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2);\n Crewzers, 741 F.3d at 1382. The Claims Court may dismiss\n a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if the plaintiff\n fails to present a non-frivolous allegation that the underly-\n ing contract exists. See id. If an agreement is plainly not\n a contract on its face, then the agreement is insufficient to\n establish subject matter jurisdiction in the Claims Court\n under the Tucker Act. On its face, McLeod\u2019s BPA lacks\n both mutuality of intent and mutuality of consideration.\n     First, we note that our previous decision in Crewzers\n essentially controls this case. With regard to the BPA in\n Crewzers, similar to McLeod\u2019s BPA, the government in that\n case was not required under the terms of the BPAs to place\n any orders with the contractor. Crewzers, 741 F.3d at 1383.\n Likewise, the contractor was free to not accept any orders.\n Id. The BPAs at issue in Crewzers \u201creflect[ed] illusory\n promises that do not impose obligations on either party.\u201d\n Id. at 1382\u201383. Thus, this case is essentially indistinguish-\n able from Crewzers.\n\fCase: 20-1389     Document: 29     Page: 7    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCLEOD GROUP, LLC   v. UNITED STATES                        7\n\n\n\n      Further, and contrary to McLeod\u2019s allegations, the BPA\n here lacks mutuality of intent. The BPA explicitly states\n that the agreement is \u201cnot a contract\u201d with the govern-\n ment. J.A. 86. The issuance of task orders pursuant to the\n BPA, while themselves presumably contracts, does not\n transform the BPA into a contract. The Claims Court\n found McLeod\u2019s reasoning on this issue not persuasive, and\n we agree. See J.A. 15. The absence of mutuality of obliga-\n tion, as indicated infra, also supports a conclusion that the\n parties lacked the requisite contractual intent. We there-\n fore conclude that, with regard to the BPA itself, McLeod\n failed to plausibly allege a mutual intent to contract with\n the government.\n     We also agree with the government that the BPA also\n lacks mutual consideration. For example, McLeod did not\n identify any performance obligation placed on the govern-\n ment under the BPA, financial or otherwise. The BPA\n states that the agreement \u201cdoes not obligate any funds,\u201d\n J.A. 84, which pretty much negates the idea of a contract.\n And we agree with the Claims Court that the BPA did not\n require the government to place any task orders. See J.A.\n 14. The ability of the government to offer McLeod an op-\n portunity to accept task orders as set forth in the BPA is\n not consideration. Regarding McLeod\u2019s alleged obligations\n under the BPA, most of the alleged obligations McLeod\n identified are pursuant to task orders as provided for by\n the BPA terms. The sole requirement for McLeod to attend\n a post-award kickoff meeting does not in itself create suffi-\n cient mutual consideration in this case, where the alleged\n contract would require real performance as opposed to\n merely attending a meeting.\n     The BPA provides that the performance obligations\n will be specified in the task orders issued pursuant to the\n BPA. See, e.g., J.A. 84 (\u201cDelivery\u201d); J.A. 86 (\u201cTask Orders\u201d);\n J.A. 87 (\u201cPlace of Performance\u201d). The BPA provides \u201cthe\n ordering procedures\u201d for \u201cservices ordered under this BPA.\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1389    Document: 29     Page: 8   Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n8                       MCLEOD GROUP, LLC   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n J.A. 89; J.A. 84. The task orders would presumably consti-\n tute contracts while the BPA does not. An agreement like\n the BPA at issue in this case is not binding upon the gov-\n ernment where no funds are obligated and the parties fail\n to plausibly allege that any other provision provides mu-\n tual consideration necessary to create a binding contract.\n See Modern Sys., 979 F.2d at 204 (citing Gavin, Govern-\n ment Requirements Contracts, 5 Pub. Cont. L.J. 243, 246\n (1972)) (\u201cUsually the parties merely arrange to do business\n when the government places an order at the unit price\n named in the [BPA]. In such an agreement, there is noth-\n ing in writing which requires the government to take any\n ascertainable quantity or amount.\u201d).\n                        CONCLUSION\n     We have considered McLeod\u2019s remaining arguments\n but find them unpersuasive. For the reasons stated above,\n we affirm the decision of the Claims Court.\n                       AFFIRMED\n\f", "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/208664/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/733360/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/505946/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/210953/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/594463/"], "case_name": "McLeod Group, LLC v.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n General Counsel, United States Department of Veterans\n Affairs, Washington, DC.\n                 ______________________\n\n     Before NEWMAN, REYNA, and STOLL, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n     Marcus Sebastian Payne appeals from the decision of\n the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\n denying his petition for a writ of mandamus. Mr. Payne\u2019s\n mandamus petition challenged the Department of Veter-\n ans Affairs\u2019 refusal to reinstate a claim and issue a Supple-\n mental Statement of the Case. For the reasons discussed\n below, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     In November 2012, Mr. Payne filed a claim for compen-\n sation for bilateral knee and low back disabilities and left\n foot and migraine conditions. The Regional Office denied\n the claims and, in May 2017, Mr. Payne submitted a formal\n appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals. In May 2018,\n Mr. Payne chose to opt into the VA\u2019s Rapid Appeals Mod-\n ernization Program, in which the RO would review his\n claim under the higher-level review option. After the RO\n higher-level review rating decision denied his claims,\n Mr. Payne requested supplemental claim review. In Janu-\n ary 2020, after Mr. Payne received a VA foot examination,\n the RO issued its rating decision denying his claims under\n the supplemental claim review option. The RO informed\n Mr. Payne that if he disagreed with the decision, he had\n one year from the date of its January 2020 letter to request\n review or appeal to the Board.\n     In February 2020, Mr. Payne filed a petition for a writ\n of mandamus in the Veterans Court, arguing that the RO\n wrongfully refused to process his claim of entitlement to\n VA benefits and issue a Supplemental Statement of the\n Case. The Veterans Court determined that Mr. Payne\n\fCase: 20-1952        Document: 40   Page: 3   Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n PAYNE   v. WILKIE                                          3\n\n\n\n could still respond to the RO\u2019s adjudication because the\n time to complete a request for review of the RO\u2019s decision\n or appeal to the Board has not yet run and Mr. Payne has\n until January 2021 to respond to the RO\u2019s decision. Payne\n v. Wilkie, No. 20-1297, 2020 WL 1518283, at *2 (Vet. App.\n Mar. 31, 2020).      The Veterans Court thus denied\n Mr. Payne\u2019s petition, concluding that \u201cmandamus is not\n warranted because Mr. Payne has not yet exhausted his\n administrative remedies.\u201d Id.\n    Mr. Payne appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292.\n                           DISCUSSION\n     We review the Veterans Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Payne\u2019s\n petition for a writ of mandamus for an abuse of discretion.\n Lamb v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002). A\n writ of mandamus is a \u201cdrastic and extraordinary\u201d remedy\n that is only appropriate when there are \u201cexceptional cir-\n cumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of\n power . . . or a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Cheney v. U.S.\n Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004) (citations and quota-\n tion marks omitted). A court must be satisfied that three\n conditions are met before it issues a writ: (1) the party\n seeking the writ must have no other adequate means to at-\n tain the relief he desires; (2) the party must show a clear\n and indisputable right to the writ; and (3) the writ is ap-\n propriate under the circumstances. Id. at 380\u201381.\n     We agree with the Veterans Court that at least the first\n of these three conditions is not met in this case. Specifi-\n cally, as the Veterans Court noted, Mr. Payne \u201chas not yet\n exhausted his administrative remedies\u201d because he has not\n pursued the ordinary appeal process in the VA. Payne,\n 2020 WL 1518283, at *2. A writ of mandamus cannot be\n used by a party to avoid the ordinary appeal process. See\n Cheney, 542 U.S. at 380\u201381. As the Veterans Court ex-\n plained, Mr. Payne\u2019s next step in the ordinary appeal pro-\n cess is \u201cto inform [the] VA of his disagreement with the\n\fCase: 20-1952    Document: 40      Page: 4   Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                           PAYNE   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n RO\u2019s [January 2020] decision and the avenue of review he\n would like to select, including whether he would like to ap-\n peal the matter to the Board.\u201d Payne, 2020 WL 1518283,\n at *2. Because the strict requirements for granting a writ\n of mandamus are not met, we conclude that the Veterans\n Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Payne\u2019s\n petition for a writ of mandamus. 1\n                        CONCLUSION\n    Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Veterans\n Court.\n                        AFFIRMED\n                           COSTS\n     No costs.\n\n\n\n\n     1     We grant Mr. Payne\u2019s Motion to Supplement the\n Record, filed on September 3, 2020, and Mr. Payne\u2019s Mo-\n tion to Supplement the Reply, filed on September 14, 2020.\n We have also considered Mr. Payne\u2019s Citation of Supple-\n mental Authority. These motions and the supplemental\n authority do not alter our determination in appeal.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n    Before NEWMAN, DYK, and WALLACH, Circuit Judges.\n NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.\n      Vera Perry, the surviving spouse of Terry L. Perry, ap-\n peals the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for\n Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d). The Veterans Court\n affirmed the decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals\n (\u201cBVA\u201d) denying Mrs. Perry\u2019s claim for non-service-con-\n nected death pension benefits and burial benefits. 1 The\n Veterans Court held that service in the state National\n Guard including a period of active duty for training, with-\n out disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty, does\n not achieve \u201cveteran\u201d status for these purposes.\n     The decision is in accordance with statute and regula-\n tion and manifests no constitutional infirmity, and is af-\n firmed.\n                        DISCUSSION\n     Terry L.

Pension Benefits\n     The BVA held that Mrs. Perry was not eligible for non-\n service-connected death pension benefits because Mr.\n Perry did not have active duty service during a period of\n war nor did he have a service-connected disability, as re-\n quired by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1541:\n     \u00a7 1541(a). The Secretary shall pay to the surviving\n     spouse of each veteran of a period of war who met\n     the service requirements prescribed in sec-\n     tion 1521(j) of this title, or who at the time of death\n     was receiving (or entitled to receive) compensation\n     or retirement pay for a service-connected disability,\n     pension at the rate prescribed by this section . . . .\n The BVA held that \u201cactive duty for training\u201d does not qual-\n ify as active military, naval, or air service for death benefit\n purposes unless \u201cthe individual concerned was disabled or\n died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line\n of duty.\u201d BVA Op. at *2 (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(24); 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 3.6(a)). The BVA found that Mr. Perry did not at-\n tain veteran status, and that he \u201cwas not service-connected\n for any disability at the time of his death, and there is no\n evidence that his death was in any way related to his Jan-\n uary to March 1977 military service.\u201d Id. at *3.\n      The Veterans Court, affirming the BVA, explained that\n entitlement to non-service-connected death pension bene-\n fits has certain active wartime service requirements, as\n provided in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1521(j):\n     \u00a7 1521(j). A veteran meets the service require-\n     ments of this section if such veteran served in the\n     active military, naval, or air service\u2014\n     (1) for ninety days or more during a period of war;\n\fCase: 20-1311     Document: 12      Page: 4    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                              PERRY   v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n     (2) during a period of war and was discharged or\n     released from such service for a service-connected\n     disability;\n     (3) for a period of ninety consecutive days or more\n     and such period began or ended during a period of\n     war; or\n     (4) for an aggregate of ninety days or more in two\n     or more separate periods of service during more\n     than one period of war.\n Vet. Ct. Op. at *2\u20133.\n     The Veterans Court found \u201cno evidence of wartime ser-\n vice,\u201d for there was no recognized period of war during Mr.\n Perry\u2019s period of active duty for training. Id. at *3. Thus\n the Veterans Court held that Mrs. Perry was not entitled\n to death pension benefits.\n      Mrs. Perry argued that the BVA erred in finding that\n Mr. Perry did not have a service-connected disability. She\n stated that the presumption of soundness on entering mil-\n itary service should apply, and that Mr. Perry\u2019s enuresis\n and incontinence at the time of his discharge from the Na-\n tional Guard could have been incurred or aggravated dur-\n ing his period of active duty for training. The Veterans\n Court held that the BVA did not err, for even if Mr. Perry\u2019s\n illnesses had been incurred or aggravated during his ser-\n vice in the National Guard, in the absence of wartime ser-\n vice Mrs. Perry was not entitled to death pension benefits,\n citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1521(j). Vet. Ct. Op. at *3.\n      Mrs. Perry argues that \u201cevery veteran should be\n treated equally,\u201d whether or not the veteran served in war-\n time. Perry Br. 1. She argues that the issue of equal treat-\n ment is of constitutional dimension. This court addressed\n the constitutionality of section 1521(j) in Burrow v. Nichol-\n son, 245 F. App\u2019x 972 (Fed. Cir. 2007), and concluded that\n \u201cit is not patently arbitrary and irrational to treat wartime\n veterans differently than nonwartime veterans for the pur-\n pose of awarding pension benefits . . . .\u201d Id. at 974 (internal\n\fCase: 20-1311        Document: 12   Page: 5    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n PERRY   v. WILKIE                                            5\n\n\n\n quotation marks omitted). The court held that there was\n no merit to the constitutional challenge to the requirement\n for service during a period of war in order to qualify for\n pension benefits. Id.\n     We affirm that, by statute, Mrs. Perry is not entitled to\n death pension benefits, and that the statutory requirement\n for wartime service for this purpose does not violate the\n constitutional right to equal protection.\n                       B. Burial Benefits\n     The BVA also denied Mrs. Perry\u2019s request for non-ser-\n vice-connected burial benefits, on the ground that Mr.\n Perry had not served in the active military, naval, or air\n service, and did not have veteran status.

UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n    Before PROST, Chief Judge, DYK and WALLACH, Circuit\n                          Judges.\n DYK, Circuit Judge.\n     On May 26, 2011, the United States Department of\n Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) issued antidumping and counter-\n vailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from the Peo-\n ple\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d) (\u201cOrders\u201d). On March 21,\n 2016, Commerce initiated an anti-circumvention inquiry as\n to heat-treated 5050-grade extruded aluminum products\n exported by China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. and its affili-\n ates. On November 14, 2016, Commerce announced in its\n Preliminary Determination that it was applying the anti-\n circumvention inquiry to all heat-treated 5050-grade ex-\n truded aluminum products from the PRC, including those\n of Tai-Ao Aluminum (Taishan) Co., Ltd. and TAAL Amer-\n ica Ltd. (collectively, \u201cTai-Ao\u201d) and Regal Ideas, Inc. (\u201cRe-\n gal\u201d), and further determined that all such products were\n circumventing the Orders. Commerce accordingly in-\n structed the United States Customs and Border Protection\n (\u201cCustoms\u201d) to suspend liquidation of all heat-treated\n 5050-grade extruded aluminum products from the PRC en-\n tered, or withdrawn from warehouse, on or after March 21,\n 2016, the date that the original inquiry was commenced.\n      The Court of International Trade (\u201cTrade Court\u201d) found\n that Commerce did not provide adequate notice to Tai-Ao\n and Regal that their products were subject to the inquiry\n initiated on March 21, 2016, and instead \u201cliquidation\n should have been suspended from the date of the Prelimi-\n nary Determination,\u201d (November 14, 2016), and remanded\n to Commerce to reformulate its liquidation instructions ac-\n cordingly.

We conclude that the Trade Court did\n not err in its remand decision and affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n                               I\n     The Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, \u201cpermits Com-\n merce to impose two types of duties on imports that injure\n domestic industries.\u201d          See Guangdong Wireking\n Housewares & Hardware Co. v. United States, 745 F.3d\n 1194, 1196 (Fed. Cir. 2014). First, Commerce may levy an-\n tidumping duties on goods \u201csold in the United States at less\n than . . . fair value.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673. Second, Commerce\n may impose countervailing duties on goods that receive \u201ca\n countervailable subsidy\u201d from a foreign government. Id.\n \u00a7 1671(a).\n     In order to effectively combat circumvention of anti-\n dumping duty or countervailing duty orders, \u201ca domestic\n interested party may allege that changes to an imported\n product . . . constitutes circumvention under [19 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1677j].\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(a) (2020). When such issues\n\n\n     1   The reformulated liquidation instructions state\n that Tai-Ao\u2019s entries that \u201cwere entered, or withdrawn\n from warehouse, for consumption during the period\n 03/21/2016 through 11/13/2016 . . . are outside of the scope\u201d\n of the Orders. J.A. 1237\u201338. This remedy has the same\n effect as suspension of liquidation for entries made on or\n after November 14, 2016.\n     Commerce did not issue reformulated instructions for\n Regal because Regal had no entries for the period between\n March 21, 2016 and November 13, 2016.\n\fCase: 20-1501    Document: 23      Page: 4    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n4            TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n arise, Commerce may initiate an anti-circumvention in-\n quiry and issue \u201cscope rulings\u201d that \u201cclarify the scope of an\n order or suspended investigation with respect to particular\n products.\u201d Id.; see also id. \u00a7 351.225(g)\u2013(j). As we noted in\n Deacero S.A. de C.V. v. United States, Commerce may then\n \u201cdetermine that certain types of articles are within the\n scope of a duty order, even when the articles do not fall\n within the order\u2019s literal scope.\u201d 817 F.3d 1332, 1337 (Fed.\n Cir. 2016); see 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677j. Anti-circumvention in-\n quiries are distinct from \u201c[o]ther scope determinations,\u201d\n which clarify whether products fall within the literal scope\n of an order. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(a), (k); see also Target\n Corp. v. United States, 609 F.3d 1352, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2010)\n (describing differences between \u201c[c]onventional scope in-\n quiries\u201d and anti-circumvention inquiries).\n     If Commerce makes a preliminary determination that\n the products are circumventing duty orders, then Com-\n merce will order Customs to \u201csuspend liquidation and to\n require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable\n rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product entered, or\n withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after\n the date of initiation of the scope inquiry.\u201d 19 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 351.225(l)(2). \u201cLiquidation means the final computation\n or ascertainment of duties on entries for consumption or\n drawback entries.\u201d Id. \u00a7 159.1. Generally, \u201cCustoms has\n one year from the time of filing to liquidate an entry under\n 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1504(a).\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. United States, 811\n F.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Suspension of liquidation\n enables Commerce to impose duties on entries that might\n otherwise escape duty liability pending Commerce\u2019s final\n determination that the products are circumventing duty\n orders. As we discuss in detail below, Commerce must pro-\n vide notice of the initiation of the scope inquiry (here, an\n anti-circumvention inquiry), which must include \u201c[a] de-\n scription of the product that is the subject of the scope in-\n quiry\u201d and \u201c[a]n explanation of the reasons for the\n Secretary\u2019s decision to initiate a scope inquiry,\u201d 19 C.F.R.\n\fCase: 20-1501     Document: 23      Page: 5   Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v. UNITED STATES           5\n\n\n\n \u00a7 351.225(f)(1)(i)\u2013(ii). If such notice is not given, Commerce\n cannot suspend liquidation of entries entered \u201con . . . the\n date of initiation of the scope inquiry.\u201d Id. \u00a7 351.225(l)(2).\n                             II\n      On May 26, 2011, Commerce issued antidumping and\n countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from\n the PRC. See Aluminum Extrusions from the People\u2019s Re-\n public of China: Antidumping Duty Order, 76 Fed. Reg.\n 30,650 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce May 26, 2011); Aluminum Ex-\n trusions from the People\u2019s Republic of China: Countervail-\n ing Duty Order, 76 Fed. Reg. 30,653 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce\n May 26, 2011) (collectively, \u201cthe Orders\u201d). The Orders ex-\n pressly included products made of alloy with an Aluminum\n Association series designation commencing with the num-\n ber 6 (i.e., designations of 6xxx) where magnesium ac-\n counted for at least 0.1 percent but not more than 2.0\n percent of total materials by weight. The Orders expressly\n excluded products made of alloy with an Aluminum Asso-\n ciation series designation commencing with the number 5\n (i.e., designations of 5xxx) and containing in excess of 1.0\n percent magnesium by weight.\n     On October 22, 2015, the Aluminum Extrusions Fair\n Trade Committee (\u201cAEFTC\u201d), a trade association of domes-\n tic producers of aluminum extrusions, filed a joint Scope\n Clarification and Anti-Circumvention Inquiry Request for\n certain merchandise from China Zhongwang Holdings,\n Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, \u201cZhongwang\u201d). On re-\n quest from Commerce, AEFTC resubmitted its request on\n December 30, 2015, and contended that Zhongwang\u2019s 5050-\n grade aluminum alloy extrusion products circumvented\n the scope of the Orders. AEFTC contended that 5050-grade\n aluminum alloy, which has between 1.1 and 1.8 percent\n magnesium by weight and therefore \u201ctechnically meets the\n scope exclusion for 5xxx series,\u201d \u201cbehaves like in-scope 6xxx\n series subject merchandise\u201d and thereby circumvented the\n Orders.

As AEFTC acknowledged, Commerce \u201ciniti-\n ated this anti-circumvention inquiry only on Zhongwang,\u201d\n J.A. 1032, even though Commerce stated that AEFTC pro-\n vided evidence that was not limited to Zhongwang, such as\n \u201cinformation indicating that domestic producers [were]\n competing with Chinese-sourced 5050-grade aluminum al-\n loy products\u201d and \u201cevidence showing that such 5050-grade\n aluminum alloy extruded products [were] marketed by\n Chinese producers to purchasers in the same manner that\n 6xxx-series [were] marketed.\u201d Initiation Notice, 81 Fed.\n Reg. at 15,043.\n      Commerce\u2019s \u201cSummary\u201d of the Initiation Notice\n stated:\n     In response to a request from [AEFTC], [Com-\n     merce] is initiating an anti-circumvention inquiry\n     pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677j(c) and (d)] . . . to de-\n     termine whether extruded aluminum products that\n     meet the chemical specifications for 5050-grade\n     aluminum alloy, which are heat-treated, and ex-\n     ported by [Zhongwang] are circumventing the anti-\n     dumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD)\n     orders on aluminum extrusions from the People\u2019s\n     Republic of China (PRC).\n Initiation Notice, 81 Fed.

UNITED STATES            7\n\n\n\n     Under the heading \u201cMerchandise Subject to the Anti-\n Circumvention Inquiry,\u201d Commerce stated, \u201cThis anti-cir-\n cumvention inquiry covers extruded aluminum products\n that meet the chemical specifications for 5050-grade alu-\n minum alloy, which are heat-treated, and exported by\n Zhongwang.\u201d Initiation Notice, 81 Fed.

But as pertinent here,\n Commerce also stated:\n       The Department intends to consider whether the\n       inquiry should apply to all imports of extruded alu-\n       minum products that meet the chemical specifica-\n       tions for 5050-grade aluminum alloy and are heat-\n       treated, regardless of producer, exporter, or im-\n       porter, from the PRC.\n Id.\n    Following the publication of the Initiation Notice, Com-\n merce issued an anti-circumvention questionnaire only to\n Zhongwang. Zhongwang failed to respond.\n     On July 8, 2016, after the deadline for Zhongwang\u2019s re-\n sponse passed, AEFTC requested that Commerce \u201cimmedi-\n ately issue anti-circumvention questionnaires to additional\n Chinese producers believed to be circumventing the or-\n ders,\u201d including Tai-Ao. J.A. 1033\u201334. It appears that\n Commerce did not issue additional questionnaires. On\n September 28, 2016, Endura Products, Inc., a domestic in-\n terested party, submitted evidence that \u201cmultiple compa-\n nies\u201d were \u201cimporting inquiry merchandise from multiple\n producers/exporters.\u201d J.A. 1060\u201361. On October 7, 2016,\n AEFTC submitted evidence \u201cindicating at least 25 other\n Chinese companies that [were] producing and/or exporting\n inquiry merchandise.\u201d Id. at 1060.\n     In a Preliminary Determination Memorandum dated\n November 3, 2016, Commerce \u201c[found] that the record sup-\n port[ed] applying [the anti-circumvention] inquiry to all\n\fCase: 20-1501     Document: 23     Page: 8    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n8            TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v.

In support of its\n determination, Commerce cited the information provided\n by Endura and AEFTC after the publication of the Initia-\n tion Notice and Commerce\u2019s \u201cprior and ongoing scope pro-\n ceedings concerning 5050 products,\u201d which demonstrated\n that companies including Regal were \u201clikewise producing,\n exporting, and/or importing inquiry merchandise.\u201d Id.\n     On November 14, 2016, Commerce published its Pre-\n liminary Determination in the Federal Register, and, un-\n der the heading \u201cMerchandise Subject to the Anti-\n Circumvention Inquiry,\u201d stated:\n     The products covered by this inquiry are heat-\n     treated extruded aluminum products that meet the\n     chemical specifications for 5050-grade aluminum\n     alloy (inquiry merchandise), regardless of pro-\n     ducer, exporter, or importer, from the PRC.\n Aluminum Extrusions from the People\u2019s Republic of China:\n Affirmative Preliminary Determination of Circumvention\n (\u201cPreliminary Determination\u201d), 81 Fed.

Instead\n of applying its Preliminary Determination to product en-\n tries made on or after November 14, 2016, Commerce ap-\n plied suspension to all entries made on or after March 21,\n 2016.

Int\u2019l Trade 2019).\n      On appeal, the Trade Court concluded that \u201cCom-\n merce\u2019s decision to suspend liquidation with respect to\n [Tai-Ao and Regal] from the date of the Initiation Notice\n was impermissible because [Tai-Ao and Regal] did not re-\n ceive adequate notice at that time. The Preliminary Deter-\n mination [on November 14, 2016] provided the first notice\n that [Tai-Ao and Regal\u2019s] products were subject to the in-\n quiry, and therefore liquidation should be assessed as of\n that date.\u201d Tai-Ao I, 391 F. Supp. 3d at 1313\u201314. The\n Trade Court remanded to Commerce to reformulate its liq-\n uidation instructions accordingly. Id. at 1316. Commerce\n filed reformulated instructions, which the Trade Court sus-\n tained as \u201cconsistent with the remand order.\u201d Tai-Ao II,\n 415 F. Supp. 3d at 1395.\n     AEFTC appeals the Trade Court\u2019s decision sustaining\n Commerce\u2019s reformulated liquidation instructions. Nei-\n ther Commerce nor any other party to the Trade Court pro-\n ceeding have appeared in this appeal. We have jurisdiction\n under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(5).\n                        DISCUSSION\n      The sole issue on appeal is whether Commerce\u2019s Initi-\n ation Notice, published on March 21, 2016, provided ade-\n quate notice to Tai-Ao and Regal that their products would\n be subject to Commerce\u2019s anti-circumvention inquiry and\n therefore their unliquidated entries entered on or after\n that date could be subject to duties. \u201cWe review the [Trade\n Court\u2019s] decision to sustain Commerce\u2019s final results and\n its remand redeterminations de novo.\u201d SolarWorld Ams.,\n Inc. v.

UNITED STATES            11\n\n\n\n interlocutory decision of a trial court on appeal from the\n final judgment.\u201d Sears Roebuck & Co. v. United States, 22\n F.3d 1082, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1994), superseded by statute on\n other grounds, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202, as recognized in JVC Co.\n of Am., Div. of US JVC Corp. v. United States, 234 F.3d\n 1348, 1354\u201355 (Fed. Cir. 2000).\n     Two subsections of Commerce\u2019s anti-circumvention in-\n quiry regulations are at issue. First, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(l)\n authorizes Commerce to order suspension of liquidation of\n merchandise entered on or after the date of the initiation\n of the scope inquiry. It provides:\n     If liquidation has not been suspended [at the time\n     of an affirmative preliminary determination of cir-\n     cumvention], the Secretary will instruct the Cus-\n     toms Service to suspend liquidation and to require\n     a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable\n     rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product en-\n     tered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consump-\n     tion on or after the date of initiation of the scope\n     inquiry.\n 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(l)(2). Thus, \u201c[w]hen Commerce rules\n that a product falls within the scope of an order, but \u2018there\n has been no [previous] suspension of liquidation,\u2019 a new\n suspension must be ordered beginning only [with entries]\n \u2018on or after the date of initiation of the scope inquiry.\u2019\u201d Sun-\n preme Inc. v. United States, 946 F.3d 1300, 1319 (Fed. Cir.\n 2020) (quoting 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(l)(3)) (second alteration\n in original); see also 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(l)(2).\n     Second, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(f)(1) requires Commerce to\n provide notice of the initiation of the anti-circumvention in-\n quiry. If Commerce decides to initiate a scope inquiry (such\n as an anti-circumvention inquiry) on application from an\n interested party, Commerce is required to provide notice\n that includes \u201c[a] description of the product that is the sub-\n ject of the scope inquiry\u201d and \u201c[a]n explanation of the\n\fCase: 20-1501    Document: 23      Page: 12    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12          TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v.

In explaining why the\n regulations require Commerce to first make an affirmative\n preliminary or final determination of circumvention before\n suspending liquidation, Commerce noted it must provide\n\n\n\n      3   Commerce has proposed regulations that would al-\n low Commerce, once it has reached an affirmative prelimi-\n nary determination of circumvention, to instruct Customs\n \u201c[t]o suspend liquidation of all . . . unliquidated entries of\n the product at issue [for which liquidation was not previ-\n ously suspended], and apply the applicable cash deposit\n rate under the order to those entries.\u201d Regulations to Im-\n prove Administration and Enforcement of Antidumping\n and Countervailing Duty Laws (\u201cProposed Regulations\u201d),\n 85 Fed. Reg. 49472, 49,501 (Dep\u2019t. of Commerce Aug. 13,\n 2020) (proposed \u00a7 351.226(l)(2)(ii)). The proposed regula-\n tions would permit Commerce to suspend liquidation of all\n entries that are unliquidated dating \u201cback to the earliest\n suspension date\u201d under the original duty orders, unlike the\n current regulations, which only allow Commerce to sus-\n pend liquidation of entries made on or after the date of the\n initiation of the scope inquiry. Id. at 49,483, 49,488.\n      Commerce has also proposed regulations that would re-\n move the current notice requirements for initiation of cir-\n cumvention       inquiries.        Compare       19    C.F.R.\n \u00a7 351.225(f)(1)(i)\u2013(ii) with Proposed Regulations, 85 Fed.\n Reg. at 49,496\u201397, 49,499\u2013500. Commerce described the\n proposed regulations as \u201cremov[ing] unnecessary and bur-\n densome notice and service requirements.\u201d 85 Fed. Reg. at\n 49,472.\n      We express no opinion as to the validity of the proposed\n regulations or their applicability to circumstances such as\n those present here.\n\fCase: 20-1501    Document: 23      Page: 13    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v. UNITED STATES           13\n\n\n\n prior notice to foreign interested parties that provides \u201ca\n meaningful opportunity to present relevant information\n and defend their interests\u201d:\n     Suspension of liquidation is an action with a poten-\n     tially significant impact on the business of U.S. im-\n     porters and foreign exporters and producers. The\n     Department should not exercise this governmental\n     authority before it has first given all parties a\n     meaningful opportunity to present relevant infor-\n     mation and defend their interests, and before the\n     Department gives a reasoned explanation for its ac-\n     tion. Formal initiation of a scope inquiry by the\n     Department represents nothing more than a find-\n     ing by the Department that it cannot resolve the\n     issue on the basis of the plain language of the scope\n     description or the clear history of the original in-\n     vestigation. It would be extremely unfair to im-\n     porters and exporters to subject entries not already\n     suspended to suspension of liquidation and possi-\n     ble duty assessment with no prior notice and based\n     on nothing more than a domestic interested party's\n     allegation. Because, when liquidation has not been\n     suspended, Customs, at least, and perhaps the De-\n     partment as well, have viewed the merchandise as\n     not being within the scope of an order, importers\n     are justified in relying upon that view, at least un-\n     til the Department rules otherwise. Therefore, the\n     Department will not order the suspension of liqui-\n     dation until it makes either a preliminary or final\n     affirmative scope ruling, whichever occurs first.\n Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties (\u201cPreamble\u201d),\n 62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,328 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce May 19,\n 1997) (Final Rule).\n     Thus, Commerce could only suspend liquidation of en-\n tries made on or after March 21, 2016, that were unliqui-\n dated as of November 14, 2016, if Commerce provided\n\fCase: 20-1501    Document: 23      Page: 14     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14          TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n adequate notice that the merchandise subject to the scope\n inquiry included Tai-Ao and Regal\u2019s products on March 21,\n 2016. The notice requirement reflects \u201cthe broader due-\n process principle that before an agency may enforce an or-\n der or regulation by means of a penalty or monetary sanc-\n tion, it must \u2018provide regulated parties fair warning of the\n conduct [the order or regulation] prohibits or requires.\u2019\u201d\n Mid Continent Nail Corp. v.

UNITED STATES         15\n\n\n\n inquiry should apply to all imports\u201d is not the same as a\n notice that such imports are within the scope of the inquiry.\n     Several other factors support this conclusion. First,\n here, the initial anti-circumvention inquiry was not coun-\n try-wide. Anti-circumvention determinations may be com-\n pany-specific or country-wide. 5 The Initiation Notice here\n was not country-wide since it named Zhongwang\u2019s products\n specifically as subject to the inquiry. Only on November\n 14, 2016, did the inquiry become country-wide when Com-\n merce announced that \u201c[t]he products covered by this\n\n\n\n determination in this inquiry to all imports of extruded alu-\n minum products that meet the chemical specifications for\n 5050-grade aluminum alloy and are heat-treated, regard-\n less of producer, exporter, or importer, from the PRC.\u201d\n Anti-Circumvention Inquiry Regarding Aluminum Extru-\n sions from the People\u2019s Republic of China (Final Determi-\n nation Memorandum) at 29 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Jul. 20,\n 2017) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\n     5   As Commerce explained in proposing new regula-\n tions for anti-circumvention inquiries,\n     In its experience, Commerce has witnessed scenar-\n     ios in which the circumvention determined to exist\n     was unique to the interested party under review.\n     In that situation, a company-specific circumven-\n     tion determination is warranted. However, Com-\n     merce has also found circumvention to exist in\n     other cases in which the circumvention warranted\n     a country-wide determination.\n Proposed Regulations, 85 Fed. Reg. at 49,489.\n     Proposed \u00a7 351.226(m)(1) would allow Commerce to\n \u201cconsider, based on the available record evidence, whether\n the circumvention determination should be applied on a\n country-wide basis.\u201d Id. at 49,501.\n\fCase: 20-1501    Document: 23     Page: 16     Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16          TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v.

Reg. at 79,445.\n     Second, the regulations require that Commerce\u2019s Initi-\n ation Notice include \u201c[a]n explanation of the reasons for\n [Commerce\u2019s] decision to initiate a scope inquiry.\u201d 19\n C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(f)(1)(ii). As explained in the Preamble, \u201ca\n reasoned explanation\u201d as to why Commerce initiated an\n anti-circumvention inquiry that could lead to the imposi-\n tion of duties helps alleviate potential \u201cunfair[ness]\u201d by\n providing \u201cprior notice.\u201d Preamble, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,328.\n     Here, Commerce\u2019s explanation for why it initiated the\n inquiry focused primarily on Zhongwang. Commerce ex-\n pressly cited AEFTC\u2019s \u201cScope Clarification and Anti-Cir-\n cumvention Inquiry Request for certain merchandise from\n Zhongwang,\u201d which Commerce described as \u201ccontend[ing]\n that Zhongwang\u2019s 5050-grade aluminum alloy extrusion\n products are circumventing the scope of the Orders,\u201d and\n Commerce explained that, \u201cin response\u201d to that request by\n AEFTC, it initiated an anti-circumvention inquiry as to\n Zhongwang. Initiation Notice, 81 Fed. Reg. at 15039\u201340.\n     Third, our determination is further supported by Com-\n merce\u2019s conduct during its investigation, which would not\n have put Tai-Ao and Regal on notice that they were subject\n to the inquiry before the Preliminary Determination was\n published. After the Initiation Notice was published, Com-\n merce issued a questionnaire only to Zhongwang, suggest-\n ing that Commerce intended its inquiry to pertain only to\n Zhongwang. In the period between the Initiation Notice\n and the Preliminary Determination, Commerce received\n additional information from domestic interested parties,\n AEFTC and Endura, that led Commerce to apply its in-\n quiry to entities other than Zhongwang. This additional\n\fCase: 20-1501    Document: 23      Page: 17    Filed: 12/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAI-AO ALUMINIUM (TAISHAN) CO.   v. UNITED STATES         17\n\n\n\n information was significant because it led Commerce to ex-\n pand the scope of its inquiry.\n     There are no other indicia that would support a differ-\n ent result. AEFTC relies on Commerce\u2019s statement in the\n March 2016 notice that, \u201c[i]n accordance with 19 C.F.R.\n 351.225(l)(2), if [Commerce] issues a preliminary affirma-\n tive determination, [Commerce would] instruct U.S. Cus-\n toms and Border Protection to suspend liquidation and\n require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable\n rate, for each unliquidated entry of the merchandise at is-\n sue, entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consump-\n tion on or after the date of initiation of the inquiry.\u201d\n Appellant\u2019s Br. 18 (quoting Initiation Notice, 81 Fed. Reg.\n at 15,044) (second alteration in original). But \u201cthe mer-\n chandise at issue\u201d at the time referred to \u201cthe merchandise\n subject to the inquiry,\u201d namely, products \u201cexported by\n Zhongwang.\u201d Initiation Notice, 81 Fed. Reg. at 15,044,\n 15,042. It was not until November 14, 2016, that Com-\n merce changed the description of the \u201cMerchandise Subject\n to the Anti-Circumvention Inquiry\u201d and thus provided ad-\n equate notice that Tai-Ao and Regal\u2019s products would be\n subject to the anti-circumvention inquiry, and liquidation\n could only have been suspended for Tai-Ao and Regal as of\n that date. Preliminary Determination, 81 Fed. Reg. at\n 79,445.\n     Because Commerce did not provide adequate notice to\n Tai-Ao and Regal until November 14, 2016, Commerce\u2019s in-\n structions to suspend liquidation effective March 21, 2016,\n were not in accordance with law.
